Twin Peaks Text Generator

This project uses a language model trained on the scripts from *Twin Peaks* Seasons 1 and 2 to generate new text in the style of the show. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's video on building an NLP model from scratch, this project aims to generate new, creative text that mimics the tone, dialogue, and atmosphere of *Twin Peaks*.

The goal of this project is to create a text generation model based on the *Twin Peaks* scripts, which can then generate new passages of text that resemble the writing style and dialogue from the show. By training the model on the original script, it learns to understand the structure of the language and can continue generating text in a similar style when given an initial prompt.

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Welcome to Twin Peaks. My name is Margaret Lantermen. I live in Twin Peaks. I am known as the log lady. There is a story behind that. There are many stories in Twin Peaks. Some of them are sad, some funny. Some are stories of madness, of violence. Some are ordinary. Yet they all have about them a sense of mystery. The mystery of life, sometimes the mystery of death. The mystery of the woods, the woods surrounding Twin Peaks. To introduce this story let me just say it encompasses the all. It is beyond the fire. Though few would know that meaning. It is a story of many but it begins with one and I knew her. The one leading to the many is Laura Palmer. Laura is the one.

BENJAMIN
Are they ready to sign?

LELAND
Are you not even going to mention that we have not as yet acquired access to the Packard land?

BENJAMIN hocks a loogey and spits it into the fire causing it to spark and crackle. LELAND turns away at the sight of this.

BENJAMIN
Sorry. (clears his throat) We have solid information. The Packard Saw Mill is going to go belly up within a year. We are going to able to get it for a song, one verse no chorus. Now let's get out there and get those cheese eaters where they live.

LELAND

BENJAMIN HORNE is animatedly speaking to Norwegian businessmen. Sitting beside him is a translator that is interpreting his selling speech.

BENJAMIN
Clean, wholesome environment much like your very own. (translator speaks) With a quality of life to rival the very best. (translations) That this country has to offer and that is what the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates will be. Now, when I first spoke to Sven he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air. If you permit me Sven (motioning to SVEN JORGENSON) to repeat what you told me after your run, 'my air sacks (Ben breathes in deeply and pounds his chest on the exhale) have never felt so good.'

After the translation the crowd laughs.

JULIE, a hotel employee, approaches LELAND and whispers.

JULIE
Your wife's on the phone again. She says its urgent.

In the background the translator is speaking to the crowd in Norwegian and again the crowd laughs.

Yeah, I'm heading home.

SHELLY looks at NORMA. NORMA is already looking at her, studying her expression.

BOBBY pays in loose change tossed on the counter. On the way out he approaches the jukebox.

CATHERINE
Do you hear me! You can't do that to my workers. Don't walk away from me like that! Come on back here! Your not going anywhere and your not going to tell anybody anything.

JOSIE and CATHERINE enter the office. JOSIE turns around to face CATHERINE and says...

JOSIE
Catherine, I'm sorry if this offends you but I am the owner of this saw mill.

CATHERINE
And you don't know the first thing about this mill. That's why I'm running it.

JOSIE
I've never taken this authority before but maybe I should have.

CATHERINE
Your not shutting us down.

JOSIE
Catherine, I have the final say-so. Peter push the plug.

CATHERINE
Pete, don't you dare.

PETE has been watching the confrontation between both women.

PETE
Oh, Catherine. Please (walks over to the phone, picks it up) Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug. (response) That's right.

COOPER
Diane, 11:30 am, February 24. Entering the town of Twin Peaks, five miles South of the Canadian border, twelve miles West of the state line. I've never seen so many trees in my life. As W. C. Fields would say I'd rather be here then in Philadelphia. Fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain. If you get paid that kind of money for being wrong sixty percent of the time it beat working. My mileage is 79,345. Gauge is on reserve. Riding on fumes here. I've got to tank up when I get into town. Remind me to tell you how much that is. Lunch was ... uhh ... (retrieves a receipt from his pocket) six dollars and thirty-one cents at the ... Lamplighter Inn, that's on highway two near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat, slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee. (emphasized) Damn good food. Diane, if you ever get up this way that cherry pie is worth a stop. Okay. (picks up card) Looks like I'll be meeting up with a ahh ... Sheriff Harry S. Truman. Shouldn't be to hard to remember that. That will be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital. I guess we're going to go up to intensive care and take a look at that girl that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain. I'm pretty sure I'll be checking into a hotel. I'm sure the sheriff will be able to recommend a clean place, reasonably priced. That's what I need, clean place, reasonably priced.

COOPER
Dale Cooper, FBI (shakes hands). Pleasure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good to meet you.

COOPER clears his throat and they both proceed to walk up the hall.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Have any trouble finding the place?

COOPER
No, no trouble to find. I came out over Highway Two near Lewis Fork. I stopped at a little place called the Lamplighter Inn, had a slice of cherry pie, incredible.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well I'll tell ya' we're sure glad to have the FBI here. We're kinda lucky in the way that Ronette step out across the state line. The whole town is very badly shaken up.

COOPER
Yeah, sure its a nice quiet place, something like this. (stops TRUMAN in the hall, now face to face) Sheriff let me just talk to you in the hallway here for just a second. There's a few things we got to get straight right off the bat. Now I've learned about this the hard way, its best to talk about it up front. When the bureau gets called in, the bureau's in charge. Now your going to be working for me. Sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that. I hope you understand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Like I said, we're glad to have you here.

COOPER now moves a little closer to SHERIFF TRUMAN and sports a grin.

COOPER
Sheriff, what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing around here? Big, majestic.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Douglas firs.

COOPER
(repeated in amazement) Douglas firs. (changes expression) Can someone give me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well the autopsy hasn't been done yet. But I'll take you down stairs to the morgue when we're finished here.

COOPER
Fine.

DR. SHELVY
Several times.

COOPER
One perpetrator?

DR. SHELVY
We're waiting for the results.

COOPER
(turns around to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Any connection to the dead girl?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Same high school. As far as we know they hardly knew each other. No connection.

COOPER
Hmm. I'd like to question her.

DR. SHELVY
This girl doesn't even know where she is or if she is.

COOPER
What exactly are you saying?

DR. SHELVY
We need a CAT scan and we are not equipped for that here. My opinion, she may have neurological damage. She's just not responsive at all.

COOPER
I'd like to examine her fingers?

DR. SHELVY looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN with a puzzled look. SHERIFF TRUMAN shrugs and gives a blank stare.

DR. SHELVY
All right.

COOPER moves over to RONETTE and grabs her left hand. With a small magnifying glass he looks at her fingernails.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
They've already scrapped for particles.

COOPER
Nah. That's not what I'm looking for. (continues looking) No, no. There's nothing here. Not a thing.

As COOPER puts her hand down RONETTE mumbles.

RONETTE
No. No. Don't go there. Don't ... don't go there.

DR. JACOBY stands quietly with his hands in his pockets and with large ear plugs in his ears. He wants to be greeted with COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is special agent Dale Cooper.

DR. JACOBY pulls out one of his ear plugs. Having misheard TRUMAN, he asks...

DR. JACOBY
Uhm, Gary Cooper?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Agent Cooper.

DR. JACOBY
Agent. (points at COOPER) F B I.

COOPER
Right.

DR. JACOBY
(slight laugh) Dr. Lawrence Jacoby agent Cooper. Laura was a patient of mine. Listen, your on your way to the morgue now. Do you mind if I join you?

COOPER
(scans DR. JACOBY from head to toe) Yes I do. Why would you want to?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It's sort of against procedure doctor.

DR. JACOBY
Well, no offense. I ... I thought I could be of some help.

COOPER
You still could be, at another time.

DR. JACOBY
Oh. I ... I understand completely, yeah. Oh. By the way, (slight laugh) Laura's ... uhh ... Laura's parents ... (slight laugh) they didn't know that she was seeing me. (little crazed laugh)

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at each other and then walk off. COOPER turns his head to look at DR. JACOBY and then to SHERIFF TRUMAN as they walk down the hospital hallway.

DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT
I have to apologize again for the fluorescent lights. I ... I think its a bad transformer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What have you got here?

COOPER
Ring finger, under the nail. Let's see what he left us.

COOPER places the piece of paper on a small sheet of glass and flattens out the piece of paper. The small piece of paper has a single letter on it.

COOPER
Its an 'R'. Diane, give this to Albert and his team don't go to Sam. Albert seems to have a little more on the ball. (to SHERIFF TRUMAN) We need a bag and tag this.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smile) Why not.

COOPER
(turns on his mini recorder). Diane, I just opened Laura Palmer's diary. This is the ... uhh ... last entry dated February 23. It reads, "asparagus for dinner again, I hate asparagus. Does this mean I'll never grow up." And then she's written, "nervous about meeting 'J' tonight". That's the letter 'J', Diane. (flips through the pages) Yeah, that is the last entry. Well that's something to get started on.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. That's one out of twenty-six.

COOPER
Yeah, one out of twenty-six. (flips through the front pages of the diary) Diane, I just turned back eighteen days to day one. What we have taped to the page here is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and what looks to be a key to a safety deposit box. Sheriff, after you very carefully remove this key I'm going to run this envelope and my bet is it will test positive for cocaine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(surprised) That's impossible.

COOPER
(looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN) You ever been surprised before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura Palmer.

COOPER
Let's get started on a court order to open that safety deposit box and maybe we'll both find out a few things about Laura Palmer.

Okay. Now, after you were done with Bobby and he was taken back to his cell. Well then his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer and Bobby he was released and he came out and he saw his friend Mike, who was down by the water cooler. Which is near my desk.

COOPER nods at her to get to the point.

LUCY
Okay, okay. Well I pretended to be typing but I was typing what Mike and Bobby were saying and ... well they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about ... but anyway. Here's what they were saying.

A mound of dirt approximately a foot and a half in diameter on top is a gold necklace with a gold heart. Correction, half a gold heart. At the base of the mound of dirt is a torn piece of newsprint written with the words, which appear to be in blood, fire walk with me.

NURSE
Mrs. Horne it might help if you talk to Johnny yourself.

SYLVIA
So, you think it might help. Well you can tell Johnny one more time that Laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him (pause as she looks at Johnny) and tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon. Now what is so difficult to understand about that! (slams a fist to the table)

There's over ten thousand dollars here. That's a lot of girl scout cookies.

Sporting a grin, COOPER looks at the magazine again and finds a dogeared page.

COOPER
There's a page that's marked.

He opens the magazine to the marked page. At the bottom right corner of the page there is a photo of RONETTE posed in lingerie. The ad has been circled with a marker.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN sit next to each other at a large table for speakers at one end of the room, opposite the entrance. The room is filled with the chatter of people.

COOPER
(a little excited) I think I saw a cotton tail rabbit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It must have been a snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER
A snowshoe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

COOPER
A snowshoe, (amazed) snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER scans the room filling with people and spots an Asian woman walking forward.

COOPER
Who's the babe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That is one of the most beautiful women in the state, Mrs. Packard.

COOPER
Packard Saw Mill?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep.

COOPER
Where's Mr. Packard?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Died in a boating accident last year. Andrew Packard practically built this town. Brought her over from Hong Kong, six years ago, left her everything. Which didn't exactly please his sister. That's her right there.

TRUMAN gestures to the woman, CATHERINE MARTELL, who is sitting on the other side of her husband, PETE MARTELL, that MRS. JOSIE PACKARD is sitting next to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The original deep freeze.

COOPER
Who's the glad handy dandy?

COOPER gestures to a man that has come up to JOSIE and is holding her hand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Benjamin Horne, local big wig, he owns half the town. He's not after her, he's after her land.

MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, an elderly man, is at the podium banging a gavel. The lights in the room flicker on and off as a woman holding a log is switching them on and off to get people's attention.

COOPER
Who's the lady with the log?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We call her the log lady.

The lights continue to flicker on and off as people slowly start to quiet down.

MAYOR
Ladies and gentlemen. Can I have your attention? (he looks around) Is this thing on? (pats the microphone) Is this thing on!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hang on mayor.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves to the podium and adjusts the microphone as the MAYOR sits down.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Mayor Milford. Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gestures to AGENT COOPER to come to the microphone. COOPER clears his throat as he approaches the podium.

COOPER
Thank you sheriff. Ladies and gentlemen, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. One year ago almost to the day in a town in the Southwest corner of this state the body of a young girl named Teresa Banks was found. She had no family, no one came forward to claim her body. It wasn't even news, until today. There are irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I can not discuss that lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second and Ronette Pulaski would have been the third victim of the same killer. Now there is a chance that the person that committed these crimes is someone from this town, possibly even someone you know. You are the leaders of this community. It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt. I would strongly suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age. Keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution that may protect them in the days and the weeks to come. I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night.

The reason I'm telling you this that Donna was in the video with her and she won't tell them who shot it or who else was with them. But they think the killer may have the other half of the heart.

DONNA returns to her room which she shares with her sister HARRIET HAYWARD. HARRIET is sitting up in bed with paper and pencil in hand.

HARRIET
Donna, which do you like better? The blossom of the evening or the full flower of the evening.

DONNA
Well, listen to me. This is serious.

HARRIET
Well this is serious too.

DONNA
Sshhh. I'm going out the window in a few of minutes and I need you to cover for me.

HARRIET
Aren't you aware that there is a curfew. They just announced it on the radio.

DONNA
Yes, I know there's a curfew Einstein. That's why I need you to cover for me.

HARRIET
I suppose this will include a phone conversation with Mike, mister bonehead boyfriend, (whispered) wow.

DONNA
No, this is about Laura and its really, really serious.

HARRIET
(whispered) Jerk.

DONNA grabs her stuffed toy and playfully rubs it at her nose.

HARRIET
Okay.

DONNA
Thank you.

DONNA walks over to the bedroom window and open it. She climbs out the window and starts down.

DONNA
Oh, I'll need to borrow your bike.

HARRIET
Oh, well ... then put a little air in the back tire. Would you?

DONNA
(teasingly) Yeah, Harriet don't forget to brush your teeth.

I don't have an alibi for last night. I was with her.

DONNA
James, what happened last night?

JAMES
It was kinda like a nightmare. Donna, she was a different person.

DONNA
What are you saying?

JAMES
I'm telling you there were things she was involved with, things she let herself get pulled into. Things she thought you hate her for. She said there were things about me ... she said even Donna doesn't know me.

DONNA
I knew her, I knew her better then she thought I did.

JAMES
Donna, she said something about a guy getting killed.

DONNA
Who?

JAMES
She didn't say but she said ... Bobby ... told her that he killed this guy.

DONNA
Oh my god.

JAMES
This is why I had to see you. It all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died. That someone killed her, I don't know I can't explain it. I didn't know whether to believe any of this last night. I mean half the time she wasn't making any sense. I couldn't calm her down. I could hardly keep her on the bike. We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21 and ... she ... she put her hands around my neck ... and she screamed she loved me. I looked into her eyes, they were clear. Its like she was Laura again. She was so sad. She sounded so desperate. Then she ran off ... (mumbles to a cry)

DONNA
(she hugs JAMES) Its okay, its not your fault James. (runs her fingers through his hair) Its okay. James, its alright. James.

JAMES starts to kiss DONNA on the cheek and then they both kiss. JAMES suddenly pulls away.

I gotta go to the police. I don't have an alibi. After she left I just rode around most of the night.

DONNA
James the necklace you gave Laura with the golden heart, you have to give me the other half.

JAMES
Why?

DONNA
Because they found the half where she was killed and they think the killer will have the other half. If you go down there with the necklace and no alibi.

JAMES
What about you?

DONNA
I'll get rid of it.

JAMES
No.

DONNA
We'll hide it.

JAMES
Alright. We'll bury it.

Okay.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns on the police siren and pursues the motorcycle. JAMES pulls his motorcycle to the side of the road and stops.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's not Joey its James Hurley.

TRUMAN grabs his microphone for the cruiser's loudspeaker.

COOPER
I told you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(through the loudspeaker) James, stand away from the bike. Stand away from the girl, put your hands behind your head.

JAMES complies by getting off his bike and, facing them, puts his hands on his heads. DONNA moves towards the police cruiser.

DONNA
He didn't do anything.

COOPER
She's probably right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, slightly annoyed, looks at COOPER and then exits his vehicle.

DONNA
James, he didn't do anything.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep. Lucy, sets it up for us every night.

LUCY
(over the intercom) Sheriff, is everything okay. There's extra jelly donuts for Agent Cooper and there's some extra decaf, (COOPER grabs a powdered donut) you know Andy's been drinking so much caffinated coffee lately ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Lucy. You can go back to work now and no listening.

COOPER breaks up his powdered donut, by hand, into little bite size pieces.

COOPER
Sheriff that reminds me. Can you recommend to me a good, inexpensive hotel or motel. Now it doesn't have to be fancy and I mean that.

COOPER eats a piece of donut and immediately wipes his hands with a paper napkin.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can give you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Because you know I think I'm going to be here for some time and these motels, they'll promise you a good rate and then when you get there its a whole different story. Now all I need is a bed, a bathroom, a telephone and sometimes a television in the unlikely event that one day I'll get a chance to knock off early.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can get you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Sold. (extends his hand to shake goodbye) Well, tomorrow come early

As COOPER heads out of the room he pulls out his mini tape recorder and turns it on.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:28 am. Looks like I'll be staying locally at a place called the Great Northern Hotel. The sheriff set the arrangements ... (walks off)

SHERIFF TRUMAN remains seated at the conference table laden with donuts and smiles to himself as he hears COOPER walk off.

We get a PANNED view of FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER'S hotel room. Starting at the bedside table where his gun is located we PAN to see two deer hooves holding up a rifle over his bed, a mounted turkey on a table in the corner of the room, a painting with ducks and to a mounted fish. We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six inches above the floor hanging from an apparatus connected to his boots. He is wearing boxer shorts, a t-shirt and a pair of socks. He is talking into the tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.

COOPER
Diane ... 6:18 am, room 315, Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks. Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room. There's no tobacco smell. That's a nice consideration for the business traveler. A hint of douglas fir needles in the air. As Sheriff Truman indicated they would, everything this hotel promised, they've delivered: clean, reasonably priced accommodations ... telephone works ... bathroom in really tip-top shape ... no drips, plenty of hot water and good, steady pressure ... could be a side benefit of the waterfall outside my window ... mattress firm, but not too firm ... and no lumps like that time I told you about down in El Paso. What a nightmare that was, but of course you've heard me tell that story once or twice, haven't you Diane. Haven't tried the television yet. Looks like cable, probably no reception problems. But the true test of any hotel, as you now well know Diane, is that morning cup of coffee. Which I'll be getting back to you about within the half hour.

COOPER grabs his tape recorder and shuts it off. He then removes himself from the hanging apparatus and stands up. With the tape recorder in his hand he starts it up again.

TUNE ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (UPBEAT VARIANT)

COOPER
Diane, it struck me again earlier this morning. There are two things that continue to trouble me, and I'm speaking now not only as an agent of the Bureau, but also as a human being. What really went on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys? And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?

The WAITRESS smiles, places the pot of coffee on the table and grabs a pencil and a pad of paper to take his food order.

COOPER
Now I'd like two eggs, over hard. I know don't tell me, it's hard on the arteries, but old habits die hard, just about as hard as I want those eggs ... bacon, super-crispy, almost burned, cremate it ...

AUDREY
Thank you. (sits) Your here investigating the murder of Laura Palmer.

COOPER
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?

AUDREY
Not exactly. See, Laura tutored my older brother Johnny three times a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and he's in the third grade. He's got emotional problems, it runs in the family. Do you like my ring?

She holds out her hand to show him her ring.

COOPER
Very nice.

SHERIFF TRUMAN tries to chew.

COOPER
Sheriff, lets get James Hurley up from cell four and talk to him straight. He was in love with Laura Palmer, my bet is she told him whatever dirt she knew about Mike and Bobby and who knows what else. (Truman listens, still chewing) Then lets have a little chat with those two perpetrators, lets also run a top to bottom on Bobby's vehicle , see what that brings us. We'll also check on the autopsy on Laura Palmer and see what that brings in. Oh, we're also gonna want to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer but lets give them a few of days to deal with their grief. Now I got the rest of our day mapped out, lets meet back here in three minutes. Harry, I really have to urinate.

DR. HAYWARD
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura. I've known her all her life, she was my daughter's best friend. I couldn't bring myself to do the postmortem, so I called Joe Fielding in from Fairvale. He did the work, I assisted. Well, this is what he found. (puts on glasses, consults sheet) Time of death estimated to be between midnight and four AM. What killed her was loss of blood. Numerous shallow wounds, no single one serious enough to have caused death. Bite marks on her shoulders also on her tongue, probably self-inflicted. Lesions on wrists, ankles, and upper arms, where she was bound. We're waiting on the toxological tests for drug use. (he takes off his glasses) Within the last ... twelve hours, she had sexual relations with at least three men.

COOPER
You've examined Ronette Pulaski as well?

DR. HAYWARD
(composing himself) Yes , ... uhh ... there's no question in my mind the same perpetrator attacked both of them in that train car.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be able to talk to us?

DR. HAYWARD
She had a severe head injury, it's still early to tell, add to that the psychological impact of the fear, ... probably ... witnessing what was happening to Laura before she ...

She starts to tremble and hears a car horn beep from the front of the house. LEO shouts from the front of the house ...

LEO
Shelly? Norma's here.

SHELLY makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained shirt and stashes it in a nearby drawer. She closes the washer door and starts it just as LEO comes by.

LEO
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?

SHELLY
Yeah, I heard you Leo.

SHELLY starts out but LEO catches her by the arm.

LEO
I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today. (pinches SHELLY'S cheek softly and holds it) Be a good girl and save me a piece 'a pie.

JAMES
None. No, sir.

COOPER turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of LAURA and DONNA HAYWARD at the picnic that we saw earlier. JAMES watches the video.

COOPER
Did you shoot this video?

JAMES bows his head in silence. COOPER fast forwards the tape to the freeze frame of the motorcycle reflected in LAURA'S eye.

COOPER
That's your cycle isn't it?

JAMES looks up and sees it.

JAMES
Yes, sir. The three of us went up there two Sundays ago.

COOPER
(gently) James, you were in love with Laura. The two of you were seeing each other secretly. No one else at school, or any of her friends knew about it. She was the homecoming queen, she was dating the captain of the football team. How much longer did you think you could keep this relationship a secret?

JAMES
Well, it was secret because that's the way she wanted it.

COOPER
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

JAMES
I think so.

COOPER
Did you know that she was using cocaine?

JAMES
Yes.

COOPER
Did you ever use cocaine with her?

JAMES
No, I tried to get her to stop and she did for a while.

COOPER
Why did she start using again?

JAMES
Something happened a couple of days ago.

COOPER
What, what happened?

JAMES
(getting emotional) I don't know. I think something scared her because she wouldn't see me. She wouldn't even talk to me.

COOPER
Did you and Laura have a fight?

JAMES
Not exactly but she said she couldn't see me anymore.

COOPER
Why?

JAMES
She didn't say.

COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out LAURA'S half-heart necklace.

Recognize this necklace?

Yes, sir.

COOPER looks at LAURA'S diary, opened in front of him, at the page for February 5th; the page marked 'DAY ONE.'

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

LUCY
(to COOPER as she hands him the phone) It has that open air sound, you know, where it sounds like wind blowing, like wind blowing through trees.

COOPER
(into phone) Yes Albert.

BIG ED takes SHERIFF TRUMAN by the arm and lowers his voice.

BIG ED
Harry, I've been thinking about last night at the Roadhouse, and something's not right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(kidding him) Yeah, when I first saw that bandage I thought maybe ol' Nadine got wind of you and Norma.

BIG ED
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me and Norma, I'd be playing harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smiles) Ain't that the truth.

BIG ED
I was there seeing Norma but I was also on my stakeout. Now I can remember Mike and Bobby grabbing Donna and I got up to walk over and I got all lightheaded. I was out on my feet before I got there. I don't even remember getting hit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What do you mean you don't remember?

BIG ED
I'm pretty sure my beer was drugged. Jacques Renault was tending bar.

SHERIFF TRUMAN thinks a moment, then nods.

Inside the store, near the front window is a toy train running and blowing a train's steam whistle. Outside the window, carrying a small tray of sandwiches is NORMA JENNINGS. She is walking to the store which is just down the block from the Double R Diner. As NORMA enters, she almost runs into a woman who's exiting, carrying a big bag of hardware. It's NADINE HURLEY.

NORMA
(pleasantly) Hi, Nadine.

NADINE
What are you doing here, Norma?

NORMA
(pleasantly) I might ask you the same question.

NADINE
(a hint of aggressiveness) And I will tell you. I've gotten all new drapes for my house. Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentlemen Jim's and we installed them together. They're a beige sheer. I was up all last night, do you know what I was doing?

NORMA
(a little worried) No, I don't.

NADINE
I was inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner. And do you know how it works, do you know what makes it work? The thing I thought of at four this morning when I was waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?

NORMA slightly shakes her head. NADINE takes a package out of the bag.

NADINE
Cotton balls. By god, those things'll be quiet now.

NADINE moves past NORMA out the door. NORMA rolls her eyes at her senselessness.

No, I had a talk with Harry there's no charge.

Yeah, she's still out of town. Let's get out of here.

COOPER
Hi, Mike, Bobby. Now before we get started, have you two fellas got your stories straight?

BOBBY
If we tell the truth, we don't have to get our stories straight.

MIKE
Besides, the sheriff told us we're just in here for fighting and uh ... it was self-defense.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER.

COOPER
Right. Well, I guess you can go then.

BOBBY

COOPER
Mm-hmm.

MIKE and BOBBY stand and make their way to the door. SHERIFF TRUMAN puts his feet up on the table.

MIKE and BOBBY stop at the door and turn to him.

COOPER
Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley, because if anything happens to him, we're coming for you.

MIKE and BOBBY stare at COOPER before leaving.

In a dressing gown, over a negligee, JOSIE PACKARD enters the kitchen, with a happy look on her face.

JOSIE
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

PETE
Uhm, no, Josie, the expression is top of the morning ... and it's just barely morning.

JOSIE
Pete, I want to thank you for yesterday, for standing up to me with Catherine.

PETE
Forget it, Catherine was wrong yesterday, period.

JOSIE
Thank you anyway.

The house intercom buzzes. PETE pushes a button on a nearby unit to answer it.

PETE
Hhellloooo.

COOPER is entering data into his electronic notebook as JOSIE, wearing a red dress, enters the living room with PETE carrying a pot of coffee and two mugs. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN rise up from their seats on the couch.

JOSIE
Hi sheriff.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mrs. Packard, Dale Cooper, FBI. You'll remember him from the town meeting from last night, I'm sure.

COOPER
(shakes her hand) Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Agent Cooper, you remember Pete Martell.

COOPER
Sure, Pete.

PETE
(nods because his hands are full) You bet.

JOSIE
Uhh, can we offer you gentlemen a cup of joe?

COOPER
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic word.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'd love a cup, thanks.

PETE places the cups down on the coffee table and starts to pour.

PETE
Sure, I'll pour that for ya'. Uhh, Mr. Cooper, how do you take it?

COOPER
Black as midnight on a moonless night.

PETE
(looks at COOPER) Pretty black.

After pouring them a cup of coffee, PETE exits the room.

JOSIE
Please, sit down.

COOPER
Mrs. Packard, I'll come straight to the point. Mrs. Packard, I understand that you'd hired Laura Palmer to come visit you twice a week to help you with your English, is that correct?

JOSIE
Yes.

COOPER
When was the last time that you saw her?

JOSIE
Thursday afternoon, about the time the mill blew five.

COOPER
That would be five o'clock?

JOSIE
Yes.

COOPER
And when did she leave?

JOSIE
In an hour, when the lesson was finished. I didn't see her again.

COOPER
How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon?

JOSIE
Something was bothering her but we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it. Something she said, though, that stuck on my mind. She said, I think now, I understand how you feel about your husband's death.

COOPER
Did she say what that was in reference to?

JOSIE
No, but after what happened to her, I can't help hearing it in my head ... like some haunting melody.

JOSIE glances at SHERIFF TRUMAN. COOPER peers over to SHERIFF TRUMAN to see that he is staring at JOSIE.

COOPER
Mm-hmm.

The phone rings.

JOSIE
Excuse me.

COOPER
Certainly.

JOSIE rises and exits the room to answer the phone. COOPER grins at SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
So Harry, how long have you been seeing her?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(about three different reactions before...) How did you know?

COOPER
Body language.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Geez Louise... uh, not long, six weeks. Andrew died a year and a half ago.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN take a drink of their coffee just as PETE briskly walks back into the room.

PETE
Fellas don't drink that coffee. You'd never guess, there was a fish ... in the percolator. (he takes away the cups of coffee from SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER) Sorry.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN already had a mouthful of the coffee and swallowed it. Both of them sit on the couch with sour faces from the taste of the fishy coffee.

He turns around and walks towards her with a glass of champagne in his hand.

BENJAMIN
In the sweetness of passing time, this hour will soon seem like a day.

CATHERINE
Sing it to somebody else. I'm no peabrain chambermaid looking for a tumble in the broom closet.

BENJAMIN
(insincerely) Sorry, didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities?

CATHERINE
Oh no, my mistake. I'd gotten used to our conducting business and pleasure.

BENJAMIN
Sweetheart, it's all the same to me.

CATHERINE
Don't sweetheart me you old dog. I'm no schoolgirl either. What's the next step? Do we escalate?

BENJAMIN
We may not have to do anything. A few more local tragedies and Josie might just run the ol' mill into the ground all by herself.

He refills his glass with champagne.

CATHERINE
The rate we're going its gonna be years before the mill's bankrupt. I don't want to wait any longer. Besides, my knothead husband may peek in the ledger and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

BENJAMIN moves to lean over the bed near her toes.

BENJAMIN
Maybe it's time to ... uh ... start a little fire.

CATHERINE
Are you talking about business or pleasure?

Well, tri temper ira.

Amen.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, I was hoping we'd have a chance to discuss the events of the past few days. Not necessarily the physical events themselves, but rather the thoughts and feelings surrounding.

BOBBY rolls his eyes and sits quietly. MAJOR BRIGGS is undeterred.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Rebellion in a young man your age is a necessary fact of life, and, candidly, a sign of strength. In other words, Robert, I respect your rebellious nature. However, being your father, I am obligated to contain that fire of contrariness within the bounds established by society as well as those within our family structure.

BOBBY still sits quietly.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter in a dialogue with me, your father. There are times when silence is golden. Silence can be taken many ways, as a sign of intelligence the quieter we become, the more we hear...

BOBBY puts a cigarette in his mouth and looks at his father. MAJOR BRIGGS calmly and firmly slaps BOBBY across the face. The cigarette in his mouth flies across the table and spears into the meatloaf on BETTY'S plate. BOBBY'S stunned more than hurt.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Now I am a tolerant man, but my patience has its limits. To have his path made clear is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence. Robert, you and I are going to work to make yours real clear.

SHELLY
Sure thing.

COOPER
Mrs. Jennings, is it true that Laura Palmer used to help you with the Meals on Wheels program, delivering hot dinners to elderly shut-ins?

NORMA
Yeah, Laura helped organize the program.

COOPER starts to eat his pie.

As COOPER eats his pie, the LOG LADY comes up to them as she passes.

LOG LADY
For your information, I heard you speaking about Laura Palmer?

COOPER
Yes?

LOG LADY
One day my log will have something to say about this. My Log saw something that night.

COOPER
Really? What did it see?

She holds the log out.

SHELLY slowly backpedals as LEO advances on her.

DR. JACOBY stands up to retrieve a pair of headphones hanging from a hook on the wall above the stereo and plugs them in. The sound of LAURA'S voice is now coming from the headphones that he is carrying around in his hands. He then walks over to his fifties-style, Hawaiian-themed rec room and grabs a coconut off a short, fake palm tree. He moves over to a large lounge chair and lays back on it.

LAURA
Which as you already know I've mailed it to you in one of the envelopes you gave me. It's Thursday the twenty-third, and I'm so bored ... actually I'm in kind'a of a weird mood. (slight cry in her voice) Doc, James is sweet ... but he's so dumb. I should've met you a long time ago Dr. Jacoby cause right now I can take just so much of sweet. I just know I'm going to get lost in those woods again tonight. I just know it. Remember me telling you about that mystery man. Well ...

DR. JACOBY puts the headphones over both ears and and we no longer can hear her voice. As he listens his face registers a whole gamut of emotions. He then opens the coconut, which is actually a stash box disguised as a coconut, in his hand to reveal the gold half heart with the leather necklace inside that was buried under the rock in the woods by JAMES and DONNA. DR. JACOBY lifts the necklace out of the coconut and starts to cry as he continues to listen to the tape.

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Sometime ideas, like men, jump up and say hello.They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words. Are they words? These ideas speak so strangely. All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again. Some ideas arrive in the form of a dream.

INT. HORNE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

In the HORNE residence wing of the Great Northern Hotel, the HORNE family sits quietly around the dinner table. BENJAMIN HORNE and SYLVIA HORNE sit at opposite ends of a long dinner table while AUDREY HORNE and JOHNNY HORNE, wearing an Indian headdress, sit opposite each other near the middle of the table. Except for JOHNNY making a few odd sounds, the room is filled with the sounds of tableware clanking as the family eats. Until the door burst open and JERRY HORNE, BENJAMIN'S younger, wiry brother, walks in. JERRY looks back out at the hall.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:00 - 0:26) (W/O SNAPS)

JERRY
No, no, no, not in my room, in here, IN HERE!

BENJAMIN
Jerry, back from Paris.

JERRY is followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying luggage into the dining room.

JERRY
Ben, what a nightmare.

JERRY shakes his head, turns back to the BELLHOPS and points down.

JERRY
Right THERE, no, no, right there! What is with you guys. (the BELLHOPS place the baggage down) I've got a sandwich in there and I want all those bags opened. We're looking till we find it.

The BELLHOPS hop to it, all the bags are opened and they are scattering clothes around until they find several sandwiches wrapped in white paper. JERRY has moved over to AUDREY.

JERRY
Hey Audrey, uncle Jerry's back. Sylvia.

JERRY moves to SYLVIA as if to kiss her.

SYLVIA
Benjamin! (repulsed and angered by JERRY)

JERRY backpedals away from SYLVIA.

JERRY
Oh-oh, ohh, okay, okay ... gone ... goodbye. (laughs)

JERRY walks over to the sandwiches, picks them all up, places them on the table and unwraps one.

JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate, it's a baguette, with brie and butter, I had four of these damn things every day I was there. You gotta try this. (hands a sandwich to BEN) Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead, go ahead.

Very interested, BENJAMIN takes the sandwich and draws his nose over it to smell it deeply.

BENJAMIN
Oh, yeah.

BENJAMIN really likes the smell of the sandwich. Grabbing the long ends of the sandwich, he takes a large bite out of it. With his mouth full he hums in ecstasy. JERRY unwraps himself one and sits nearby at the fireplace. JERRY'S mouth is soon full from a bite of his sandwich and is laughing at BEN'S reaction.

BENJAMIN
(with his mouth full) Uhm, this is incredible, Jerr.

JERRY continues to laugh with his mouth full as BENJAMIN madly takes another big bite out of his own sandwich. SYLVIA is annoyed by their actions. BENJAMIN and JERRY talk to each other with their mouths full.

BENJAMIN
You know what this reminds us of.

JERRY
Mmm.

BENJAMIN
(barely intelligible) Remember when we were kids.

JERRY
Mm.

BENJAMIN
It reminds us of Jeanne and Jenny down by the river. Do you remember? Hmm.

JERRY
My god, your right.

BENJAMIN
Am I right, am I right. Hmm.

JERRY
(laughs) Oh, no wonder.

BENJAMIN
Hmm, hmm. (laughs)

They now both laugh and hum with satisfaction from their sandwiches. BENJAMIN motions to JERRY to follow him.

BENJAMIN
Jerr, outside, outside.

BENJAMIN HORNE wipes his mouth, puts his napkin on the table, rises, smiles and looks around at his family.

BENJAMIN
Always a pleasure.

The rest of the HORNE family continue to eat silently at the table as BEN and JERRY leave the room. They both leave carrying their sandwiches and close the door to the dining room. SYLVIA has both of her hands to her bowed head in frustration.

They both laugh slightly.

JERRY
I like those odds. All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

BENJAMIN
That's right.

JERRY
Let's jump in the boat.

BENJAMIN and JERRY walk away and we FOCUS on the wall they were standing by. The wall has a painting of a lake surrounded by the woods.

BENJAMIN
Hi, sailor.

SWABBIE
Good evening, Mr. Horne.

BENJAMIN walks over to the SWABBIE, extends his arms as does she, rubs his hands over her elbows and smiles at her. JERRY comes up besides them.

JERRY
Now Ben, we're not gonna go into the casino first, are we?

JERRY
Yodehlaayeehoo.

BEN and JERRY approach the bar and JERRY orders the drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.

JERRY
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks, one double scotch on the rocks and my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks. (winks)

BARTENDER
That's two double scotch on the rocks?

JERRY
Next stop, rocket science.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (DARK VARIANT)

Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter the room one after another. They luxuriously arrange themselves standing into two rows. BEN and JERRY take note of them as they pick up their drinks. Through the middle of the line of girls sweeps BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, an intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her mid-thirties.

BENJAMIN
(whispered) Wow. Blackie.

BEN walks over to her with his arms extended out to her.

BLACKIE
Benjamin.

BEN kisses her hand and walks around her as he recites ...

BENJAMIN
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. (BLACKIE is amused, JERRY is bored and turns away to smile at the BARTENDER) Rough winds do not shake the darling buds of May, and every fair from fair sometimes declines. By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd. But thy eternal summer shall not fade. Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, Nor shall death brag ...

JERRY walks up to them and interrupts by saying ...

JERRY
Where's the new girl?

BENJAMIN
Heads.

JERRY and BENJAMIN look down at the coin: heads. BEN smiles, kisses Blackie, pats his brother on the back, and starts towards the WOMAN.

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

As BENJAMIN slowly walks toward the WOMAN, she appears nervous and looks away slightly. Near her, BEN extends his palms up for her to guide him into the next room. The WOMAN'S nervousness disappears as she grabs his hands and guides him into the next room. JERRY watches.

JERRY
Wow.

BLACKIE
Come on, we'll take care of you Jerry.

JERRY, slightly depressed, is led to the bar by BLACKIE. JERRY looks at the BARTENDER.

HAWK

COOPER
Hey Hawk, how's Ronette Pulaski?

HAWK
(over the phone) Body and spirit are still far apart.

COOPER
What did you find out from her parents?

HAWK

COOPER

HAWK

COOPER
Did you question him?

Never mind, toss it over here, quarterback.

BOBBY tosses the football to LEO.

BOBBY
It's empty.

MIKE
There's a ... there's a problem.

BOBBY
Laura had the other half in a safety deposit box.

LEO
You think you got problems?

BOBBY
We can get it, Leo, just wait till everything settles down.

LEO
You punks owe me ten grand. (shines his light on his boots) Leo needs a new pair of shoes. (moves the light back to BOBBY)

BOBBY
Okay, we won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.

LEO
Do I look like a bank!?

BOBBY
I appreciate your position, but this thing with Laura, how could I anticipate that kind of thing.

LEO

BOBBY
Tell me about it.

LEO
Maybe. Someday.

LEO'S right next to BOBBY, MIKE is standing to the left side of BOBBY. MIKE reaches into his pocket. Without taking his eyes off BOBBY, LEO slowly swivels the shotgun around and trains it on MIKE and then places the light on his face.

LEO
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.

MIKE slowly takes his hand out and lifts them up.

BOBBY
What is your problem, Leo?

LEO
(shines the light on his own face) Problem? You want to know about problems?

BOBBY
Okay.

LEO
Your on the road ... driving back and forth, gone for days. You get back and guess what?

BOBBY
What?

LEO
You find out your old lady's been givin' it away.

BOBBY

LEO
Yeah. Steppin' out, in your own damn bedroom. That's a problem.

BOBBY
Yeah, I guess so. I guess it is. (LEO shines the light on his face) Do you know who?

LEO
A man needs a clean house.

BOBBY
Sure yeah ... so do you know who?

LEO
(moves the light to MIKE) I'll take care of it.

BOBBY
Sure you will man and this other thing, hell, we'll take care of that, don't you worry about that. We'll get the cash and everything'll be square.

LEO shines the light on his own face and laughs. He pauses for a while and stares at BOBBY then says ...

LEO
Go out for a pass.

BOBBY
What?

LEO drops the light, pumps the shotgun to load it and points it at BOBBY. MIKE and BOBBY are frightened and slightly raise their hands.

Wearing a greasy gas station outfit, 'BIG' ED HURLEY enters the house and stops when he sees NADINE rowing away. BIG ED tries to tiptoe around behind NADINE so she doesn't see him but in doing so he steps on the drape runners and cotton balls laid out on the floor. Cotton balls and the drape runners scatter as BIG ED tries to keep from falling. Some of the grease from his hands falls on the cotton balls. NADINE hears the ruckus and stops rowing to see what has happened.

NADINE

BIG ED
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.

NADINE
You stepped on my drape runner.

BIG ED
Well, honey, it was right out in the middle of the floor.

NADINE
ED, YOU MAKE ME SICK!

In the woods, a large blackboard is set up behind the station. A table is set up near the blackboard, covered with the fruits of LUCY'S morning donut run. Four folding chairs are set up near the table. They are all carry mugs of coffee. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK are at the table of donuts. COOPER is at the blackboard and has just placed the chalk down. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN stands near COOPER with a galvanized metal bucket filled with round rocks.

ANDY
Where do you want these rocks?

COOPER
Put them right down there by the donuts, Deputy.

ANDY complies. LUCY picks up a coffee pot.

LUCY
Anyone for a warm-up?

EVERYONE
(severally) Ahh yeah, please ... thanks ... you bet ... thanks Lucy.

They all move over for their cups to be refilled. After being served more coffee, COOPER takes a sip and immediately spits it out on the floor. Everyone looks at him.

COOPER
Damn good coffee ... and hot! Would everyone please take a seat.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, HAWK, ANDY and LUCY sit on four folding chairs aligned facing the blackboard. COOPER takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket and expands it to full length.

COOPER
By way of explaining what we're about to do, I'm going to first talk to you a little bit about the country called Tibet.

COOPER flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to it. The seated group all slowly lean forward.

COOPER
An extremely spiritual country, for centuries the leader of Tibet has been known as the Dalai Lama. In 1950, Communist China invaded Tibet and while leaving the Dalai Lama nominally in charge, they in fact seized control of the entire country. In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India for his life, and has lived in exile ever since.

COOPER collapses his expanding pointer.

COOPER
Following a dream I had three years ago, I have become deeply moved by the plight of the Tibetan people, and have been filled with a desire to help them. I also awoke from the same dream realizing that I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique, involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the deepest level of intuition.

We view a CLOSEUP on LUCY, ANDY, HAWK and TRUMAN. We see that they are all intrigued, but completely mystified.

COOPER
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me, I will now demonstrate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK look at each other and stand up. The blackboard is flipped to the other side. COOPER expands his pointer again.

COOPER
You will recall that on the day of her death, Laura Palmer wrote the following entry in her diary.

COOPER points to where this line is written along the top left side of the blackboard.

COOPER
Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight. Today we're going to concentrate on the 'J's.

COOPER circles the 'J' with chalk. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK stand near him.

COOPER
Harry, when I give the word, would you please read aloud each of the names I've written on the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okey-doke.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk, stand over here (points near the bucket) and hold this bucket of rocks up near me where I can get at them. Would you please put on the kitchen mittens?

HAWK complies.

COOPER
Deputy Andy, move down, stand by the bottle.

ANDY rises, places his coffee on the donut table, and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy to help. HAWK now has the mittens on and is standing with the bucket in his hands.

COOPER
Lucy, take this piece of chalk. (calls out to ANDY) Not too near Andy!

ANDY moves over and LUCY takes the chalk from COOPER.

LUCY
Oh, I'm ... getting excited.

COOPER
And if I should strike the bottle after Sheriff Truman says a particular name, make a check to the right of that name. (turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Oh sheriff, I almost forgot, when you say the name, also briefly state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer. Ready?

EVERYONE
(severally) Ready!

COOPER picks out a rock and holds it. He nods to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who looks over to HAWK before proceeding.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

LUCY
You did it, you hit it.

COOPER
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck but did not break, very important. Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was!

LUCY and ANDY follow directions. COOPER nods to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Sorry Andy.

LUCY
Sweetie?

ANDY
(immediately reassuring) It didn't hurt ... it didn't hurt a bit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.

Except for LUCY, they all laugh slightly, including ANDY. As COOPER picks up another rock, SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls him aside to talk privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Coop, tell me ... the idea for all this really came from a dream?

COOPER
(smiles) Yes, it did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks back over to his spot near the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(doesn't know who this is) Uh, Jack ... with One Eye.

LUCY
Maybe its the letter 'i' ... but there's no 'i' in Jack.

COOPER
I think perhaps it means he only had one eye, Lucy.

HAWK
Sounds like uh ... Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No no no, there's a casino up North called One-Eyed Jack's across the border on the Canadian side.

COOPER
That's it, we're gonna have to go up there and check that place out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okay.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this because it's a place and not a person. Actually, maybe the person could be in the place. So should I erase it?

COOPER
Yes.

LUCY
Yes, a person could be in the place or yes, I should erase it.

EILEEN
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

DR. HAYWARD
(turns to look at AUDREY) Yeah, saw her at church. I wonder what she's doing down here.

AUDREY places a coin in the jukebox.

AUDREY moves over to the counter, removes her large black coat, folds and places the coat on a seat and sits down in an adjacent seat. NORMA comes over to take her order.

NORMA
Hi Audrey.

AUDREY
Hi Norma, could I have a cup of coffee please.

NORMA
Sure.

NORMA walks off to fetch her coffee. AUDREY turns to look at DONNA who is staring at her with a bit of a scowl. DR. HAYWARD is once again eating his pie and speaks to EILEEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Remind me to stop at the hardware store and get those sixty watt bulbs.

NORMA places an empty cup in front of AUDREY and fills it from a pot of coffee. NORMA looks her over, AUDREY appears preoccupied.

AUDREY
Thanks.

NORMA nods and walks off. AUDREY takes a sip of her coffee, places it back down and wipes the lipstick from where she drank it. Once again, she turns to look at DONNA. DONNA is still looking at her but without the scowl.

DONNA
I'm going to go say hi.

DONNA walks over to AUDREY and sits beside her.

DONNA
Hi.

AUDREY
Hi Donna.

DONNA
So my parents said they saw you at church today, I didn't see you.

AUDREY
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.

DONNA
What do you mean? I didn't even think you liked her.

AUDREY
There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did help take care of my brother Johnny. Guess I sort of loved her for that.

AUDREY runs her finger around the rim of her coffee cup, staring into the cup.

AUDREY
Do you like coffee?

DONNA
Yeah, with cream and sugar.

AUDREY
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

DONNA
(smiles) Audrey.

They both giggle.

AUDREY
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.

AUDREY continues to run her finger around the rim of her cup of coffee. DONNA looks at her still grinning about what she said. AUDREY stops and looks at DONNA somberly.

AUDREY
Can I ask you something?

DONNA
Sure.

AUDREY
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

DONNA
What do you mean?

AUDREY
(looks away) Nothing.

DONNA
No, what do you mean.

AUDREY
He used to sing to her. (looks over to the jukebox) God I love this music. (turns to DONNA) Isn't it too dreamy.

AUDREY gets up from her seat, walks over to an open area of the floor near the jukebox and starts to seductively sway to the sound of the music. EILEEN sees her dance and gestures to DR. HAYWARD to take a look. From her seat, DONNA looks oddly at her as she moves to the music.

LUCY looks up from behind the reception window with a book on Tibet in her hands.

ALBERT
(abruptly) Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.

LUCY
Albert?

ALBERT

Still seated in the conference room, COOPER turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, Albert and his team are the cream of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Working for you, I wouldn't expect anything less.

COOPER places his left hand on SHERIFF TRUMAN'S shoulder.

COOPER
But I gotta warn ya, Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Nobody's perfect.

COOPER
Isn't that the truth?

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks over to his shoulder. COOPER quickly grabs his nose with left hand and makes a 'quack' sound. They both laugh.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk into the reception area and up to ALBERT and his team. COOPER is grinning as ALBERT says ...

ALBERT
What the hell kind of a two-bit operation are they running out of this tree house, Cooper?

COOPER
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

ALBERT
I have seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.

SHERIFF TRUMAN has a somewhat angered look on his face. COOPER knows ALBERT well and keeps his cool with a large smile.

ALBERT
What are you waiting for, Christmas? We've got work to do damn it. They're putting this girl in the ground tomorrow and we've wasted half the day traveling out here to the middle of nowhere.

COOPER
Al ... Albert, I suggest you and your team should get started.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.

ALBERT
That'll be fine.

COOPER
(hands ALBERT a file) Results from the local pathologist's report.

ALBERT
(scans it scornfully) Welcome to amateur hour. (to his men) Looks like an all-nighter boys.

They pick up their suitcases.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(moves to ALBERT) Albert, got a minute?

SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls ALBERT aside from the group to talk to him privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I hear that you're real good at what you do.

ALBERT
Yeah, that's correct.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well that's good, because normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this kind of crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on queer street.

ALBERT and SHERIFF TRUMAN look eye-to-eye. ALBERT blinks first, puts on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. LUCY enjoyed the confrontation and smiles as they leave. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER, who, with a smile, gives him a thumbs up.

NADINE
Oh Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.

BIG ED
Why's that?

She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.

NADINE
You don't know what you've done for me.

Well you could wash your socks separately.

CATHERINE walks into the bathroom holding a small jar. PETE quietly rises, silently picks up a small vase from the dresser, dumps the contents into his hand and takes out a small key with a tag.

SONG: PENNSYLVANIA 6-5000

He walks into the center of the room and then turns his head to LAURA'S picture on a nearby table. LELAND moves to photograph and picks it up. Slowly, at first, he starts to spin around in place holding the photo at arms length. Faster and faster he spins and starts to moan and then wail. Startled by the sound and the music, SARAH PALMER enters the room to see LELAND dancing and wailing.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see. One chants out between two worlds ... fire ... walk with me. ... We lived among the people. I think you say, convenience store. We lived above it. I mean it like it is, like it sounds. I too have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder ... oh, but when I saw the face of god, I was changed. I took the entire arm off. My name is Mike. His name is Bob.

We see a large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. Next to it is a coffee table with a model of Saturn. A LITTLE MAN, three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his back to COOPER, shaking violently. Two of the easy chairs are close together. Beside them are two tall Saturn lamps. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER sits across from COOPER in one of those chairs.

COPPER stares at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and she stares back at him. He turns to look at the LITTLE MAN. The LITTLE MAN stops shaking, turns to COOPER and claps his hands once.

LITTLE MAN
Let's rock!

The LITTLE MAN moves over and sits in a chair beside the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly together, a ringing sound is produced.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER looks at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, who is still staring at him and smiles enigmatically. She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...

LITTLE MAN
I've got good news! That gum you like is going to ... come back in style.

COOPER sits quietly listening to him and turns to the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN turns to look at the WOMAN and then back to COOPER.

LITTLE MAN
She's my cousin, ... but doesn't she look ... almost exactly like Laura Palmer?

COOPER
But it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I feel like I know her, (distressed) but sometimes my arms bend back.

LITTLE MAN
She's filled with secrets. Where we're from, the birds sing a pretty song ... and there's always music in the air.

Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The LITTLE MAN hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN rises, goes over, and gently kisses COOPER on the mouth. She then softly whispers something in his ear.

AUDREY
Do you really think so?

COOPER
Yes I do. Please have a seat. And would you write your name down for me. Here. (he gives her a pen and a napkin)

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY writes her name down on a napkin and COOPER watches. From his pocket, he removes the note that was slipped under his door and compares the handwriting to AUDREY'S signature as she writes it.

COOPER
Audrey, there's something you'd like to tell me.

AUDREY
There is?

COOPER
You slipped this note underneath my door the night before last.

Griddle cakes, slice of ham.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who killed Laura Palmer?

COOPER
(sips his coffee) Ahhh. Harry, let me tell you about the dream I had last night.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Tibet?

COOPER
No. You were there, Lucy so were you. Harry my dream is a code waiting to be broken. Break the code solve the crime.

LUCY
(taking notes; repeats) Break the code ... solve the ... crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at what LUCY is writing as she repeats the line. She is a little embarrassed by it after she notices that she was being watched.

COOPER
In my dream, Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer. Deputy Hawk sketched his picture. I got a phone call from a one-armed man, named Mike. The killer's name was Bob.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mike and Bobby?

COOPER
No, its different Mike and a different Bob. They lived above a convenience store. They had a tattoo, fire walk with me. Mike couldn't stand the killing any more so he cut off his arm. Bob vowed to kill again so Mike shot him. Do you know where dreams come from?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Not specifically. (he and LUCY nod no)

COOPER
Acetylcholine Neurons fire high voltage impulses into the forebrain. These impulses become pictures, the pictures become dreams but ... no one knows why we choose these particular pictures.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well, what was the end of this dream?

COOPER
Suddenly it was twenty five years later. I was old sitting in a red room.

INT. WAITING ROOM

We review the last portion from COOPER'S dream as we hear his voice describing the dream. A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER, slowly moves over to COOPER.

COOPER
There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman. The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer, which she did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What cousin?

In the replay of dream, the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gently kisses COOPER on the mouth and then whispers something in his ear.

COOPER
The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets, sometimes her arms bend back, where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance, Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.

Harry, our job is simple. Break the code, solve the crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN'S police radio buzzes for an incoming call, he answers it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. (reply over the radio) You hang on I'll be right there. That was Andy, there's a fight over at the morgue.

COOPER

COOPER'S breakfast had just arrived and he scans it over knowing he won't be able to enjoy it because he has to leave.




CUT TO:

INT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

We view a CLOSEUP of LAURA PALMER'S face. We ZOOM OUT to view that LAURA PALMER'S body is on an examining table covered with a sheet. On the other side of the table, in the background, BENJAMIN HORNE is looking down at her. We are in an examination room of the hospital in the morgue. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and DR. WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.

ALBERT
Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.

BENJAMIN
Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)

ALBERT
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.

ALBERT
The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.

COOPER
Gentlemen!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's going on!

ALBERT
Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.

ALBERT
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's the holdup?

ALBERT
Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I've had just about enough of your insults.

ALBERT
Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.

ALBERT
Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.

COOPER
Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.

ALBERT
Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!

COOPER
That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.

ALBERT
He hit me.

COOPER
Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

DR. HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

MOONIE
I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion. Your husband has been a model prisoner. (puts the picture away in a folder) An inspiration to god and inmate alike. He greets the day with a smile and confound adversity with a kind word. Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, baring unforeseen circumstance. With your full support, before the board, he could be released shortly thereafter. Any questions?

NORMA

Well Leo is one of those guys you keep on a list and keep your eye on. So far we haven't caught him with the paws in the cookie jar.

They both walk up to LEO who is chopping wood outside his house.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Leo.

LEO
Who the hell is he? (gestures to COOPER)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI. We'd like to ask you a couple of questions?

LEO
So ask.

COOPER
Leo, is that short for Leonard.

LEO
That's a question?

COOPER
Did you know Laura Palmer?

LEO
No. (splits a log)

COOPER
How well did you know her?

Nothing, you can look it up.

In the dining room, BOBBY BRIGGS, wearing a suit, is facing a christian cross hanging on the wall. He is smoking a cigarette. At first he looks at the cross and then stretches his arms out, imitating. Then he slowly moves toward it, with both hands, as if to grab it. MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, in his usual Air Force uniform, enters the room from the side.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert. (surprised, BOBBY turns to him) This may be a good time for a brief discussion.

BOBBY
You want to talk about cigarettes, today!

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, but put it out. Its a filthy habit especially for a varsity athlete.

BOBBY takes one last drag, turns to the table and extinguishes his cigarette in a ash tray. He then takes a seat at the table. His father follows suit next to him.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have attended my share of funerals, too many. Anytime a man dies in war, he dies too soon. (places his hand on BOBBY'S shoulder, it annoys him) Laura died too soon as well.

BOBBY
Yeah, she did.

MAJOR BRIGGS
But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert. Responsibility is the linch pin of our society. Each man responsible for his own actions. Each action contributing to the greater good.

BOBBY starts to play with his cigarette lighter; opening it, lighting it and closing it.

BOBBY
What's the good of putting someone in the ground.

BOBBY lights the cigarette lighter and places it on the table. As his father speaks, BOBBY waves his hand over the flame.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Its man's way of achieving closure. The ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind. Robert, in your life you must learn, you will learn, to carry on without them.

BOBBY
Great.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination to enter a meaningful exchange. This leads to stalemate ... the desire on my part to pour certain wisdom upon you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes its the best course available. Son don't be afraid. We'll all be there together.

BOBBY closes his lighter.

BOBBY
Afraid of what?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well the funeral.

BOBBY
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. Afraid? I can hardly wait. AFRAID! I'M GOING TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN!

BOBBY is upset but composes himself. MAJOR BRIGGS sits with a disenchanted look. BETTY BRIGGS, putting on handgloves, enters the room smiling completely unaware of what has just conspired.

BETTY
Everybody ready?

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk up a hallway in the building. DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK' HILL meets them as he enters the hall from a side door.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk.

HAWK
Agent Cooper, there's no sign of the man with one arm.

COOPER
Keep trying he's out there somewhere.

HAWK splits. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER walk up to the door to the conference room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

COOPER
Tracker?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The best.

COOPER
Oh. (look of admiration)

Together they enter the conference room where ALBERT is seated at the table.

COOPER
Okay Albert, what ya' got?

ALBERT
Enough forensic spade work to save your butt and get mine out of this god forsaking burg.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN sit together opposite ALBERT. Next to ALBERT is a television monitor and video cassette player along with a folder filled with the materials he has collected in his investigation of LAURA'S body.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What ya' got?

ALBERT gives him a smirk.

ALBERT
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.

COOPER
Sometimes my arms bend back.

ALBERT
Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.

ALBERT
Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be ... claw marks. Bites of some kind.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
An animal?

ALBERT
(smiles and points at TRUMAN; smartass) Look its trying to think.

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.

ALBERT
Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. (throws a small packet with the item for them to inspect) I'm taking it back to the lab for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word primitive. I note with some interest what appears to be the letter 'J'.

COOPER
Good work Albert.

ALBERT
Couple more days with the body who know's what else I might have found.

DEPUTY ANDY peers through the open door of the conference room.

ANDY
Sheriff, its time.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Excuse us. We ... have got a funeral to get to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room. COOPER also gets up to leave.

ALBERT
Cooper, may I have a word with you alone?

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.

ALBERT
There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.

COOPER
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.

ALBERT
What?

COOPER
Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.

ALBERT
Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.

COOPER
With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:27 pm. I'd like you to look into my pension plan options regarding outside real estate investment. I may look into purchasing a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.

Oh Ed, last night was wonderful. Oh my darling Ed, you came back to me. Now I feel like we're really together again. At high school I used to watch Norma and you at the football games. She was so pretty and you made such a handsome couple. But I knew, even though I was just ... a little nobody, just a little brown mouse. I always knew inside ... once you got to know me ... that we be together forever.

NADINE hugs him and lays her head on his chest. BIG ED has a distant look on his face. A motorcycle can be heard outside the house.

NADINE
That's not your bike is it Ed?

BIG ED
It's James.

NADINE

JAMES enters the house and sees NADINE in BIG ED'S arms.

BIG ED

JOHNNY is sitting on the floor wearing a large Indian headdress of feathers. DR. JACOBY sits opposite of him, very close and nearly face to face, as he whispers to him.

DR. JACOBY

EXT. GHOSTWOOD MEMORIAL PARK - DAY

We start with a CLOSEUP of REVEREND CLARENCE'S face as he gives the sermon. Our view then switches to a bird's eye view of the crowd around casket. As REVEREND CLARENCE BROCKLEHURST gives his sermon, we view several different faces in the crowd starting with COOPER, DONNA HAYWARD, BOBBY and BIG ED. Next as the sermon continues we view COOPER follow BOBBY'S eyes to JAMES who has just arrived. BOBBY scornfully looks at JAMES. DONNA and JAMES look at each other. PETE has tears in his eyes as he looks at the casket. AUDREY and COOPER look at each other and smile.

REVEREND CLARENCE
I am the resurrection and the life. He that believe'th in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And who shall ever live'th and believe'th in me shall never die. For none of us live'th to himself and no man die'th to himself. For if we live, we live unto the lord and if we die, we die to the lord. Whether we live therefore or we die, we are the lords. Blessed be the dead who die of the lord. Even so say'th the spirit. For they rest from their labors. The lord be with thee. Let us pray. Oh god entrust this child, Laura, to thy never failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom. Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today. Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days.

JOHNNY
Aaamen! Amen!

REVEREND CLARENCE
Thank you Johnny.

BOBBY
AAAAAMENN!

From the back of the crowd BOBBY moves himself forward pushing people out of the way.

BOBBY
What ya' looking at? What are ya' waiting for? You make me sick. You damn hypocrites make me SICK! Everybody knew she was in trouble but we didn't do anything. All you good people, you wanna know who killed Laura. YOU DID! We all did and pretty words aren't going to bring her back man so save your prayers. She would've laughed at them anyway.

From the other side of the crowd, behind the crowd, JAMES rushes over to confront BOBBY. BOBBY sees him and reciprocates. MIKE NELSON also runs over. We view the action as COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK, MAJOR BRIGGS and BIG ED rush to catch, and stop them from fighting.

BOBBY
You are dead man, your dead!

Our view of the scene is now SLOWED down as COOPER and BIG ED hold back JAMES, SHERIFF TRUMAN and MAJOR BRIGGS hold BOBBY and HAWK holds MIKE back.

BOBBY
Yyyoouurrr ddeeaadd!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's enough Bobby, that's enough.

BOBBY
Yyyoouu aarree DDEEAADD!

The action returns to NORMAL. JAMES stops his attempt as he is held back by COOPER and BIG ED but he stares down BOBBY. BOBBY continues to wrestle with his father and SHERIFF TRUMAN as he yells at JAMES.

BOBBY
Get off of me. You are a dead man, dead! You are dead man, dead! Get off of me.

Near the casket, LELAND is crying heavily for his daughter. Suddenly he spreads his arms out and throws himself onto the casket. SARAH PALMER screams. The casket, being held above the bottom of the grave by straps connected to a motor, starts to move down. The mechanical system is overwhelmed by the extra weight and generates a screeching metal sound as it fails.

LELAND
Oh my baby, Laura.

LELAND hugs the casket as it slowly moves down into the grave but the mechanical system kicks in again. It starts to raise the casket out of the grave but fails again and the casket goes down again. Again and again the mechanical system tries to lift the casket and fails producing the sound of screeching metal each time. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER try to grab LELAND.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland.

REVEREND CLARENCE
The whole thing has gone haywire.

SARAH
(to LELAND) Don't ruin this too.

LELAND

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

At the counter, SHELLY JOHNSON retells the scene at the funeral to two customers having a meal. Using a metal napkin dispenser and her hand, making an inverted peace sign, she visually shows what happened.

SHELLY
This is the father (her hand) and this is the daughter in the coffin (napkin dispenser).

With her hand, SHELLY uses it to look like a small man on the edge of the counter. With her free hand she is holding the napkin dispenser off the counter but to the edge. Next, she shows how LELAND jumped on the casket by dropping her 'small man' onto the dispenser.

SHELLY
Boom.

She finishes by raising and lowering the napkin dispenser with her 'small man' on top. SHELLY also provides the sound effects of crying and of the broken machinery. The two customers laugh at it all.

We PAN to a booth in the background were BIG ED, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK are seated. The table has three empty pie plates and cups of coffee.

BIG ED
I'm telling you Harry. He's just not going to figure this out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, that's a bet I'll take for the check. (COOPER enters) He's right on time.

BIG ED
Harry, careful who you trust. He's just not one of us.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper. Take a seat.

COOPER
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed. (nods to them)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How would you like some fresh huckleberry pie?

BIG ED waves to NORMA.

COOPER
I would love a slice of pie. (NORMA arrives to take a food order) Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated, vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.

NORMA
Coming right up.

Before she leaves, she looks at BIG ED and smiles. BIG ED has been starring at her and returns the smile. COOPER immediately makes the connection.

COOPER
Big Ed, how long have you been in love with Norma?

Completely surprised, BIG ED doesn't say a word. He just looks over to HAWK and SHERIFF TRUMAN, who is smiling.

TUNE ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (VARIANT)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.

BIG ED grabs the check on the table.

COOPER
Okay, what you fellas call me in to talk about besides the highlights of the dinner menu?

BIG ED
Better tell him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border. We've been working this for six months trying to set up a bust: top to bottom, nobody walks.

COOPER
Who's targeted?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacques Renault, bartender at the Roadhouse. We figure him for the middle man. Now Ed's been doing some undercover. In fact, the night you got into town he was staking Renault out. We think Renault slipped him a mickey.

BIG ED
Felt like somebody hit me with a log splitter.

COOPER
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's not.

COOPER looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little surprised, then returns to BIG ED.

COOPER
Well that's a little outside your jurisdiction, don't you think?

BIG ED
Somebody selling drugs to high school kids and I figure that's everybody's jurisdiction.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I call Ed in when I need him. He's not the only one I call.

NORMA arrives with COOPER'S pie and a pot of coffee. COOPER digs right into his pie as she fills his cup with coffee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks Norma.

NORMA
Enjoy.

COOPER
(relishing) Mmm, this must be where pies go when they die. Mmm.

COOPER
Okay Harry, would you please tell me why you really called me in here.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, your gonna have to go along with me on this. Even if it sounds a little weird.

COOPER
I'm with you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Twin Peaks is different, a long way from the world. You've noticed that.

COOPER
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's exactly the way we like it but there's a ... back end to that that's kind of different too. Maybe that's the price we pay for all the good things.

COOPER
What would that be?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but ... its been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we've always been here to fight it.

COOPER
We?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Men before us, men before them and after we're gone.

COOPER
A secret society. (wide eyed, great interest)

BIG ED, HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER enter the Bookhouse, a darkly lit log building with a bar on one side of the room. Shelves, floor to ceiling, loaded with books divide the space, opposite the bar, into compartments.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is where we get together. Going on twenty years now.

COOPER
We meaning?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys. The coffee's free.

COOPER
I like the sound of that.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leads COOPER to a compartment where JAMES HURLEY and JOEY PAULSON guard a young man tied up in a chair with a gag over his mouth. The young man is BERNARD RENAULT a younger brother of JACQUES.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, you know James.

JAMES
Agent Cooper.

COOPER
James.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Joey Paulson.

COOPER
Joey.

JOEY nods to COOPER.

COOPER
Who is this?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bernard Renault, Jacques brother, janitor at the Roadhouse. Bernard came across the border this morning with an ounce of cocaine in his kitbag. I thought we'd ask him a few questions.

JOEY removes the gag over BERNARD'S mouth.

COOPER
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer?

BERNARD speaks with a heavy French-Canadian accent.

BERNARD
I don't sell drugs.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule?

BERNARD
Jacques don't pay me nothing. I'm no mule.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So that ounce you had that was for personal use?

BERNARD
That's right.

COOPER
I guess you don't get a whole lot of sleep at night then, huh Bernie.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your brother didn't come into work the last few days. Where's he been?

BERNARD
I don't know. He got personal business.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who else is he dealing with?

BERNARD
Why don't you ask him yourself? He be back tonight, in a minute.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's coming to work at the Roadhouse?

BERNARD
He the bartender isn't he.

COOPER

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The usual reasons would have something to do with stealing maybe worse.

JOSIE looks into the safe and sees only one book, not the two she expects to find. She pulls out the one book and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who looks it over.

JOSIE
There were two. I saw them. You believe me don't you.

LUCY
Uhh thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to kill himself and he's changed his will, leaving the Towers to Jade instead of Emerald but Emerald found out about it and now she's trying to (TRUMAN and ANDY look at each other in befuddlement) seduce Chet to give her the new will so she can destroy it. Montana's planning to kill Jared at midnight so the Towers will belong to Emerald and Montana but I think she's going to double cross him and he doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet.

He wears a pair of glasses with one red lens and one blue lens. AGENT COOPER sits at the other end of the table sternly watching DR. JACOBY perform a magic trick. The magic trick has two white balls between the fingers on one hand. He taps that hand against his head and one ball disappears. He opens his mouth to reveal the ball. DR. JACOBY performs the trick twice before COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Was Laura Palmer seeing you because she was addicted to cocaine?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help ya' but uh ... got a little problem here, uh. Look may-maybe there's some sort of hula we can do around my doctor / patient confidentiality, huh.

COOPER
It is safe to say she came to you because she was having problems?

DR. JACOBY
Oh my yes.

COOPER
Were her problems of a sexual nature?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, the problems of our entire society are of a sexual nature.

DR. JACOBY stands up, walks over to the blackboard with the map of Tibet and looks it over.

DR. JACOBY
Tibet. (smiles) You know, my abiding interests lie to the East as well but only as far as Ha-vai-i (Hawaii). The ancient Hawaiians often turn to the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant to ease the pain of profound confusion. Which, more often then not, was sexual.

COOPER
Ginger is nonaddictive, cocaine is.

DR. JACOBY
Look the-the fact that-that Laura Palmer sought medication, no matter how dubious, was actually a positive sign.

COOPER
Dr. Jacoby, I understand you cared deeply for Laura Palmer. Why is it that you won't help us?

DR. JACOBY moves toward COOPER.

DR. JACOBY
My ... own ... personal investigation, I suspect, will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the room. Now close to COOPER, DR. JACOBY bends slightly to him and says ...

DR. JACOBY
Laura ... had ... secrets ... and around those secrets she built the fortress ... that, well that in my six months with her, I was not able to penetrate and for which I consider myself ... an abject failure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby Briggs or James Hurley with you?

DR. JACOBY
Now they were boys, Laura was a woman.

COOPER
She had sex with three men the night she was murdered. Were you one of them?

DR. JACOBY looks as if he is going to proudly say yes but sighs and says ...

DR. JACOBY
No.

COOPER
Who killed her Dr. Jacoby?

DR. JACOBY
The night after Laura died, I followed a man that uh ... Laura had spoken to me about. He was driving a red corvette. I followed him to the old sawmill road and then I lost him. And that gentlemen is all I can tell you.

The intercom unit buzzes. LUCY'S voice can be heard over the speaker.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, there's a Gordon Cole on the phone. He say's your expecting his call. Should I put him through?

COOPER
Yes Lucy, put him through. Thank you doctor that will be all.

DR. JACOBY heads out but is stopped at the door by a question.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You'll be in town doctor?

DR. JACOBY
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble Beach ... but that's not till the end of the month. Hang loose howies.

DR. JACOBY gives a hang loose hand sign and leaves the room.

COOPER
Does Leo Johnson drive a red corvette?

COOPER moves to a small table along the wall, picks up the intercom unit and places it on the table.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes.

COOPER
How we doing on Jacques Renault?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's an APB on him. His brother made bail this morning. I got an all points on him too.

COOPER composes himself before turning the intercom unit on. The man speaking over the intercom is GORDON COLE, COOPER'S superior.

COOPER
Harry this is my supervisor. (presses the button on intercom unit) Good morning Gordon. How we doin'?

GORDON
(over the speaker) Cooper, where do we start? The Palmer girl or Albert's new best friend, Harry Truman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little worried, walks over to the window.

COOPER
Laura Palmer.

GORDON
Albert has been very busy. The twine he found in her upper arm is a common household variety, Finley's Fine Twine.

COOPER
And the twine on her wrists?

GORDON
Definitely not a match. No ID yet and those marks on her shoulders, bird bites.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bird bites?

GORDON
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction of the plastic fragment from her stomach.

COOPER
Great, tell Albert we're anxiously waiting his results.

GORDON
Now for the bad news Coop. I got an OJ and a AFO here from Albert concerning his mano y mano with the local Sheriff Truman. Albert wants this guy's badge Coop.

A little agitated, COOPER stands up and becomes rather animated as he talks.

COOPER
Gordon, here's how it is. You know Albert. In my opinion Sheriff Truman displayed the patience of a saint 'not' clocking him a day earlier then he did.

GORDON
He wants it filed with the US Attorney.

COOPER
File it under 'F' for forget it.

GORDON
Cooper?

COOPER
And you tell Albert that if he wants to pursue this I'll fight him all the way up the chain to Washington.

DEPUTY ANDY walks into the room.

GORDON
Cooper? Coop, don't get excited and hang up on me now.

COOPER
Talk to you later Gordon.

COOPER presses the button on intercom unit to hang up.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks. I didn't ... get a whole lot of sleep last night.

COOPER
Harry, the last thing I want you to worry about, while I'm here, is some city slicker I brought into your town relieving himself upstream.

ANDY hands COOPER the drawing he produces using SARAH'S description from her vision.

COOPER
This is the man I saw in my dream.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You saw this man?

COOPER
I had an intuition that my dream and Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. I didn't go with you this morning because I didn't want to influence her. I'm a strong sender. (to ANDY) The eyes were a bit closer together.

The intercom buzzes and LUCY can be heard from the speaker.

LUCY
Deputy Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.

COOPER picks up a nearby phone.

COOPER
Hawk. (reply over the phone) Right. Stay there. Follow him if he moves.

COOPER hangs up the phone and turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN and ANDY.

COOPER
Traveling East on highway 12, how long will it take us to reach the Timber Falls Motel?

CATHERINE and BENJAMIN take a sip of wine. We can hear the television program.

MONTANA

COOPER draws his gun and stands behind ANDY. SHERIFF TRUMAN knocks on the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Gerard, its the police, open up.

ANDY fumbles with his gun to pull it out of the holster and drops it. The revolver discharges when it hits the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER jump. COOPER is furious for the loss of control in a serious situation. He spins around and shouts.

Oh, Bob Lydecker is just about my best friend in the world.

COOPER
Why have you been at the hospital the past two days?

ONE-ARMED MAN
He's just about the best dern veterinarian in these parts?

HAWK is on the phone near a bedside stand.

HAWK
Thanks. (hangs up) He's clean, no record, no warrants.

HAWK tosses MR. GERARD'S wallet to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who hands it to COOPER. COOPER scans it over before handing it to MR. GERARD. SHERIFF TRUMAN gives HAWK an order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Take a look at his car.

We watch DEPUTY ANDY nervously move and peer at a closed suitcase standing atop a table.

COOPER

ONE-ARMED MAN
Named after my uncle.

COOPER
How'd you lose the arm?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Car accident. I was on the road from Memphis to ... uh ... someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals. (waxing enthusiasm) Pretty good job.

A commotion of rumbling comes from the side of the room. We view ANDY slightly embarrassed as he fumbled in opening the suitcase causing its contents of shoes to spill out onto the table and the floor.

ONE-ARMED MAN
That's what I'm selling these days. Everybody needs shoes.

ANDY
There all for the right foot.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Its my sample case. (picks up a shoe) Yeah, two day delivery, guaranteed. Oh and we could certainly take care of all your departmental needs.

COOPER

ONE-ARMED MAN
What's this all about? I'm a shoe salesman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

Are you saying you think Laura was one of them?

AUDREY
I don't know but if its true wouldn't you want to know about it.

Well, it sure'd explain a few things.

PAROLE JUDGE #1
You were not incarcerated for an act of fate Mr. Jennings.

HANK
I accept that ... but it was fate. Maybe, in an odd way, even luck that sent me to prison. Just as much as the car accident.

A llama disrupts AGENT COOPER as he speaks with SHERIFF TRUMAN by walking between them and even nearly touching his face with its face. The llama snorts as it walks by.

COOPER

ANDY walks up to COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN.

Leo's not going to be a problem for us anymore. Just stay clear of him, keep quiet.

She moves back to the cabinet, reaches into the stash compartment and pulls out a gun.

SHELLY

BOBBY
Do you know how to use it?

SHELLY opens the top of her waitress uniform, revealing some lingerie, and holds the gun to her chest.

HAWK notices COOPER'S gun before he puts it back in its holster.

HAWK

COOPER
Actually its standard issue. I made a few modifications. (privately to TRUMAN) How long has Lucy been upset with Andy?

HAWK
Amen to that.

HAWK puts on his ear protection cover.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Amen. Hawk, Andy.

The rest also put on their ear protection cover.

HAWK confidently and quickly fires his gun at the practice target down the gunnery range. ANDY has a hard time just holding on to the gun as he quickly fires. When their finished, the target sheets are retrieved from the distant shooting area by a motorized line. They all remove their ear protectors and rest them on their shoulders around their neck. HAWK collects the target sheets and hands them to COOPER. COOPER checks over the target sheets to see how they scored.

COOPER
Hawk, six for six. Two kills, high marks. Andy. (ANDY'S target sheet has no holes) Andy what we need is practice and lots of it. One hour, three times a week. Harry you'll supply the ordinance.

HAWK
One woman can make you fly like an eagle another can give you the strength of a lion but only one in the cycle of life can fill your heart with wonder and the wisdom that you have known a singular joy. I wrote that for my girlfriend.

COOPER, impressed, whistles. He returns his attention to the target sheets.

COOPER
Harry, one miss five hits. Three kills, excellent.

SHERIFF TRUMAN silently looks over COOPER target sheet and then hands it to HAWK.

HAWK
Only four hits?

COOPER
Well I put four through the eyes and one through each nostril.

We view the target sheet and see two holes where the eyes and where the nostrils would be in the human form of the target sheet.

HAWK
Nice pattern.

LUCY speaks over the intercom.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's and, for instance, I have here in the 'A's an Arky who's a part poodle part rottweiler, who lives on Maple and belongs to Mr. Rumple. Then, for example, I have an Annette who's an otter, who lives with a family near Elk river.

COOPER
We wanted the name of birds.

LUCY
I know but the files are all organized alphabetically.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy, go through the bird file.

I don't think I'd be very good company.

DONNA
(over the phone) Well I ... I think we need to talk.

A bell rings from the opening of the front door to the diner. JAMES turns his head to look at who has entered. He sees a dark haired woman walk to the counter of the diner.

DONNA
(over the phone) Uhm ... I found out some things. Audrey told me some stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw something.

JAMES
What?

DONNA
(over the phone) Well if you come over I could tell you.

JAMES
I'm going to get something to eat and then I'll be over in a little bit.

DONNA
(over the phone) Okay, bye.

JAMES hangs up the phone and walks over to the woman. Its MADELEINE standing by the counter waiting for her food order to arrive. JAMES stands right to the side of her and stares at her. At first she doesn't notice but then turns to face him and says ...

MADELEINE
Hi. (removes her glasses)

JAMES
Who are you?

MADELEINE
My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura was my cousin.

JAMES
(introduces himself) James Hurley.

MADELEINE
Laura and I hadn't seen each other much ... recently. I live in Missoula. Did you know Laura well?

JAMES
I thought I did. (smiles)

SHELLY
Here you go I got your order ready.

MADELEINE
Thanks a lot.

SHELLY
Mm-hmm.

MADELEINE picks up her food order and holds it in her arms as she speaks to JAMES.

MADELEINE
I'm picking up food for my aunt and uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right now and uncle Leland's up half the night listening to old music and crying and stuff ... but if I was cooking for them they'd be doing even worse. (laughs)

JAMES still stares at her.

MADELEINE
You think I look like Laura?

JAMES
Yes. (nods)

MADELEINE
We used to come visit Twin Peaks when I was a kid. It was great. We'd pretend we were sisters. I wish I'd known her better. It's so sad. Well, it was nice to meet you James Hurley.

They shake hands.

JAMES
Nice to meet you too.

BENJAMIN
What's that? No I ... I don't know what you get when you cross a Norwegian and a Swede. (reply) Oh, very good sir, very good. I can't tell you how excited we are about bringing Icelandic investment to the great Northwest. Would you put my brother back on please. Jerry, who the hell is that joker. Your sure that he's the boss. Just make sure they don't start taking eggnog into the pilot. Jerr, I got the jet gassed up and on the runway in Seattle. Usher these guys through customs, make your connections and save me some of whatever it is that their having. (hangs up) Yeah.

He continues to pedal and just barely notices AUDREY at his side.

BENJAMIN
Oh Audrey. I didn't hear you come in. What is it this time?

AUDREY
Daddy are you ashamed of me?

BENJAMIN
Audrey your uh ... your my daughter.

AUDREY
I was thinking about what we were talking about the other night when you were so mad.

BENJAMIN
It isn't that I'm ashamed of you, Audrey. Its just that I'd wish I could depend on you more. Especially during a trying time like this.

AUDREY
Well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Dad, I want to change my life. I've decided I want to help you with the family business. I mean, one of these days you'll need someone to take over and obviously it's not going to be Johnny.

BENJAMIN
(slight laugh) Oh Audrey, I wish that I could believe you.

AUDREY
Daddy please. I saw a friend of mine ... cut down like a flower that had just begun to bloom. Life can be so short. (exhales) There isn't all the time in the world. I see that now and I want to change my life.

BENJAMIN
How exactly?

AUDREY
Well I don't need to go to college. You can teach me the business and I'm willing to start at the absolute bottom.

BENJAMIN
Alright. We've got some guest arriving. You go up stairs and start making some beds.

AUDREY
You still don't believe me.

BENJAMIN
Alright, okay, (stops pedaling) okay, alright, (gets off the motion cycle) alright. (walks away from her towards his desk) Where would you start?

AUDREY
Well I think I should start at the department store. Cosmetics or something. Just part time at first till I graduate.

BENJAMIN
Your really serious aren't you?

AUDREY
You have to start to think about the future daddy. Just like I am.

BENJAMIN
The future?

AUDREY
Our family's future. Please let me be your daughter again.

BENJAMIN
Audrey.

He turns and holds out his arms. AUDREY moves to him and gives him a hug.

TUNE: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

As she hugs her father she sees a photograph of LAURA PALMER and herself, dressed in heavy winter clothing, on his desk. The telephone rings. They separate as BENJAMIN moves over to the phone to answers it.

BENJAMIN
Hello this is Benjamin Horne.

The phone call requires privacy. He covers the mouth piece with his hands and says ...

BENJAMIN
I have to take this sweetheart.

AUDREY
Oh okay. Thanks daddy.

Slowly she walks toward the door but before she exits she turns around to look at him. BENJAMIN peers at her to make sure she's leaves before he talks.

BENJAMIN
Thank you Audrey.

AUDREY finally leaves. BENJAMIN returns to the phone.

BENJAMIN
Where've you been? (reply) Meet me down by the river in a half hour and be discreet.

Nah, he shouldn't have trusted me but like I said Bernie wasn't too bright.

Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

COOPER
Diane, it is 4:28 am, I have just been woken up by the most god awful racket which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice. (pauses to record the loud singing) Can you hear that? Up until this moment, I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel but the most pleasant, courteous service imaginable. However, it just goes to prove a point that once a traveler leaves his home he loses almost 100% of his ability to control his environment. Diane I was wondering if you could overnight express to me two pairs of those Ear Pillow silicone ear plugs which I used on my last trip to New York. Naturally I didn't bring them with me on this trip because I didn't feel it would be necessary. However.

DR. HAYWARD
Um uh the blood on the shirt you found here is AB-. Its not Laura's blood.

COOPER levels his head as he diverts his attention.

COOPER
So it was Jacques Renault's blood on Leo Johnson's shirt.

DR. HAYWARD gives a puzzled look to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who is also mystified by that statement. COOPER returns to staring at the light fixture. The phone rings and DR. HAYWARD moves away to answer it. ANDY comes up to COOPER carrying a donut and a cup of coffee.

COOPER
Oh, thank you Andy.

COOPER takes a bite of the donut and then a sip of coffee. He clearly relishes it. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks up at the light fixture again and soon he has ANDY doing the same thing.

COOPER
What about Leo Johnson? (to ANDY) Could you hold this for a second?

COOPER hands his coffee and donut to ANDY to hold as he grabs a pair of tweezers from his coat pocket.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We think he went out last night. Nothing yet.

ANDY takes a bite of COOPER'S donut.

COOPER
Harry, could you give me a leg up here?

Out of sight we hear DR. HAYWARD on the phone.

DR. HAYWARD
(into phone) Oh, I need you to find out something for me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

DR. HAYWARD
(into phone) What's Jacques Renault's blood type?

SHERIFF TRUMAN cups his hands so COOPER can place his foot there. COOPER sets his foot and SHERIFF TRUMAN lifts him up slightly as COOPER takes a step up to reach the light fixture.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Allyy-oop.

We see DR. HAYWARD with a surprised look on his face as he says ...

DR. HAYWARD
Jacques Renault's blood is AB-.

COOPER
Thanks doc.

DR. HAYWARD
My pleasure.

When COOPER comes back down he holds in his tweezers a copy of Fleshworld, a swingers magazine.

TUNE: AUDREY'S DANCE (0:00 - 0:10 W/O SNAPS)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Holy smoke, Fleshworld again.

COOPER
Yeah. Harry remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?

They both move over to a nearby table. COOPER thumbs through the magazine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We traced that ad. It came in a magazine in a plain envelope, no name.

COOPER
The magazine's a clearing house. Readers write letters in response to the ads and mail them into the magazine. The magazine forwards them on to the advertisers. (finds an envelope in the magazine; looks at TRUMAN) No direct contact. (looks at the envelope) Ronette received her letters at this post office box.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's a local zip code.

COOPER
Well my guess is that this post office box will be registered under the name of Jacques Renault. (looks at TRUMAN) Lets see who's writing to Ronette. Post marked Georgia

SHERIFF TRUMAN rolls his eyes and looks away. DR. HAYWARD walks up to them. COOPER opens the envelope and pulls out a photograph that he and DR. HAYWARD look at.

DR. HAYWARD
Good night. (dismayed)

COOPER
I don't know. The beard sort of ruins the effect of the lingerie. What do you think?

COOPER hands the photo to SHERIFF TRUMAN to look at it.

In the kitchen, we see SHELLY JOHNSON, wearing a robe, carrying two plates of food to the table. BOBBY BRIGGS sits at table smoking a cigarette. She places one of the plates in front of BOBBY and the other at an open chair for herself.

BOBBY
I love it when you cook for me.

SHELLY
Leo hates my cooking.

She returns to the stove.

BOBBY
Leo missed the boat with you baby. The biggest mistake of your life was dropping out of the eleventh grade and marrying that roadhog.

By the stove, she turns to face him, smiles and says ...

SHELLY
What would you do if he walked in right now?

BOBBY
Come here.

SHELLY moves over to him.

BOBBY
Come here.

He grabs the belt on her robe, pulls her next to him and sets her down on his lap. She laughs slightly and he kisses her. He reaches into her robe pocket and pulls out the gun she bought. He pretends to point it as if LEO was across the table.

BOBBY
Hey Leo. How's it going man? (SHELLY laughs) What a surprise. Now Leo, Shelly tells me that you don't like her cooking. I'll tell you what. She and I, we're gonna sit here. While you cook breakfast for us, you hump. And if you so much as utter one harsh syllable to this ... (turns to SHELLY) beautiful girl. (turns to pretend Leo) I'm going to shoot your ugly face off, okay man.

TUNE ENDS: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (1:12 - 2:11)

BOBBY
(relieved) Ohh, the sheriff's deputy. Now Shelly do exactly what we said and everything gonna be fine. Okay.

SHELLY nods and they kiss. BOBBY starts to move away but returns to her for one more kiss before he hides just outside behind the rear door. Nervous, SHELLY takes a few puffs from a cigarette. The door bell rings and SHELLY moves to answer it. BOBBY peers inside through a window in the door. SHELLY turns to look at him before she opens the front door.

SHELLY
Oh hi Andy. Come on in.

ANDY
(walks in) Hi Shelly. Do you know when Leo might be back?

SHELLY
Uh-uh. Is he in some kind of trouble?

ANDY
No, we just want to talk to him.

As they talk, our view switches to seeing BOBBY smile as he watches them and listens on.

SHELLY
This wouldn't be about Laura would it?

ANDY
Why do you say that?

SHELLY
Well I-I heard him talking to this guy Jacques the night he left.

ANDY
Jacques Renault?

SHELLY
Yeah, um they were outside arguing. I couldn't hear exactly but they did seem to be arguing about her and then they drove off together.

ANDY
Shelly, you call us the minute he gets in touch with you.

SHELLY
Okay, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

ANDY walks out. SHELLY closes the door, leans against the back of the door and smiles as she looks over to BOBBY. She walks over to BOBBY. He reenters the kitchen. She hops into his arms, he picks her up and holds her.

SHELLY
How I do?

BOBBY
You did great.

In the kitchen, they spin around and kiss.

BOBBY
Your driving me crazy.

BOBBY moves to the kitchen counter by the sink and places her on the countertop. ANDY'S police cruiser can be heard driving off outside. The phone rings. BOBBY, kissing her neck, picks it up and holds it at SHELLY'S mouth and ear for her to answer it.

SHELLY
Hello. (she grabs the phone and pushes BOBBY away) Hi Leo. Where you calling from?

LEO
(over the phone) Did anybody come by?

Listening on, BOBBY motions to her to say 'no'.

SHELLY
What's that? Is anybody looking for you? Why would anybody be looking for you?

LEO
(over the phone) Are you sure?

SHELLY
You know how paranoid you get when you been popping vendies on the road a couple of days. So when are you coming home

LEO
(over the phone) Soon. Everything okay?

SHELLY
Yeah, everything fine Leo.

Hope you don't mind my coming.

BIG ED
Oh no.

He walks to her and meets her halfway. Together they walk to a nearby tow truck. NORMA has her hands in her coat pocket. BIG ED holds onto her left arm as they walk.

BIG ED
Nadine won't be back from that patent attorney over there in Fairvale for a couple of hours.

NORMA

NORMA
I didn't want to tell you on the phone ... but Hank got his parole.

BIG ED
Okay.

Now behind the tow truck, they turn to face each other. They lose their smiles. BIG ED looks disappointed.

NORMA
He'll be coming home. I mean back. I only saw him a minute before the hearing. He seemed so hopeful. I didn't want to say anything.

BIG ED
You don't have to explain.

NORMA
Have you said anything to Nadine yet?

Maybe that's our trouble Ed. We never want to hurt anyone. We never just take what we want. There's a part of me that's beginning to think that ... this is how it is when you get to the end of your life ... and that you don't have anything to show for it.

BIG ED

(grabs his tie) Because if you don't I'm going to rip my dress in half and scream at the top of my lungs and tell my father that you made a pass at me. Does that help to clear things up for you?

JAMES
Donna, there's some things I gotta say. I told you that my dad died when I was ten. He didn't die. He was a musician. We were living on the West coast. He was a bum and ran off on me and my mom.

DONNA
I'm sorry.

JAMES
My mom is a writer. She was really good; poems and short stories. She's an alcoholic. If you have a problem with this I know you didn't ask to hear it.

DONNA
(nods no) I don't have a problem. You tell me.

JAMES
Its true, she was out of town this week but ... she wasn't traveling. What she does is, she goes to another town, shacks up in some cheap hotel with a couple of bottles and (look away) ... picks up guys and ...

Tears form in his eyes. He walks away, still in the gazebo, to look at the lake. DONNA moves to him and hugs him from behind.

DONNA
Its alright.

JAMES
I'm telling you this because I don't want to have any secrets from you. I don't want there to be any lies between us. (turns to face her) Its the secrets people keep that destroy any chance they have of happiness and I don't want us to be like that.

We won't will we.

It is. James and I knew Laura better than anyone did. She was in some kind of terrible trouble before she died. Worse then any of us can imagine.

DONNA
Well I rather not say to much about things we can't prove yet.

MADELEINE
You said you can't prove it 'yet'?

DONNA
We loved Laura. We're afraid that the truth might never come out or that the person who killed her might never be caught. We've sworn on her memory not to let that happen.

JAMES
We have some ideas.

DONNA
We wanted to talk to you about this because we need your help.

MADELEINE
What do you want me to do?

DONNA
Laura used to talk about a secret hiding place she had somewhere in her house. Maybe in her room. I'm not really sure but nobody else knew about it. We think she might have left something there that could lead us to the killer.

MADELEINE
(nods yes) I'll help you.

DEPUTY HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and DR. HAYWARD are hiking in the woods. HAWK leads the way. COOPER wears an FBI labeled jacket. SHERIFF TRUMAN carries a rifle. DR. HAYWARD, wearing a hat and coat, follows several paces behind using a large wooden pole, as a hiking stick, to help him along. The area of forest they are walking through is desolate, hilly and has many pine trees.

HAWK
This way. Through here.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(jokingly) Watch your step there city boy.

COOPER
Thanks Harry.




CUT TO:

EXT. RAVEN - DAY

We watch a raven land and perch onto a tree branch.




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Leading the group, HAWK finds a very young pine tree snapped. A sign that someone or something has passed by. HAWK put a hand up for them to stop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What is it Hawk?

HAWK looks it over, turns to the group and then walks on. The group follows.




CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

From a distance, we view a log cabin surrounded by the woods.




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

All but DR. HAYWARD, who is still trying to catch up, stand together looking at the cabin.

COOPER
Not the cabin we're looking for.

HAWK
Maybe, maybe not.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Might want to hang back a step doc.

DR. HAYWARD
Huh, might want to anyway.

DR. HAYWARD stops just short of them and leans on his pole as he breathes heavily. SHERIFF TRUMAN turns to check on him and shows some concern. DEPUTY HAWK pulls his gun out of his holster.

TUNE ENDS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME   




CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

They all reach the side of the cabin and slowly, with guns drawn, walk outside the exterior log wall toward the front of the cabin. As they pass a window they duck down slightly. Unexpectedly, the 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN, holding her log, walks around the corner and meets them face to face. Caught off guard HAWK, TRUMAN and COOPER all point their weapons at her.

LOG LADY
'Bout time you got here. They move so slowly when their not afraid.

She walks off around the corner. Under the porch of the cabin, she turns and sees that HAWK, COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD are hanging back a distance away.

LOG LADY
Come on then. My log does not judge.

She walks into her cabin.




CUT TO:

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

From inside the cabin we watch SHERIFF TRUMAN put his rifle down and DR. HAYWARD puts his walking stick down on a bench just outside the door way. A teapot can be heard whistling from the stove. HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD enter but stand near the door. COOPER stands underneath the doorway, just behind them. The LOG LADY pours the hot water from the kettle into a teapot.

LOG LADY
I've got tea. I've got cookies. No cake.

COOPER
That's very kind of you ma'am but I don't believe that we...

HAWK puts his hand up to silence COOPER.

HAWK
What kind of cookies?

LOG LADY
Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

HAWK turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN, nods and moves to take a seat at the table. DR. HAYWARD follows suit.

DR. HAYWARD
(removes his hat) Cup'a tea would be very nice.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are still at the door. COOPER moves to talk to him but is interrupted by ...

LOG LADY
Shut your eyes and you'll burst into flames.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smiles) Thanks Margaret.

The LOG LADY places the teapot onto the table and sits down. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER move to take a seat at the table.

LOG LADY
We'll let it steep.

COOPER moves to grab a sugar cookie from a nearby tray. The LOG LADY slaps his hand as he touches a cookie.

LOG LADY
Wait for the tea. The fish aren't running.

HAWK grins at him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You've been expecting us Margaret?

LOG LADY
Your two days late ... but that's your concern. My log saw something. Something significant.

COOPER
What did your log see?

LOG LADY
Tea first. Then be ready.

She pours each of them a cup of tea.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(after she pours him some tea) Thanks.

LOG LADY
My husband was a logging man.

COOPER
Oh.

LOG LADY
He met the devil. Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke.

DR. HAYWARD
It was the day after the wedding. Wasn't it Margaret?

HAWK
The wood holds many spirits. Doesn't it Margaret?

The LOG LADY picks up her log off the floor beside her, puts it in her arms and holds it towards COOPER.

LOG LADY
You can ask it now.

COOPER looks to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who nods to him to go on. COOPER bends slightly toward the log and says ...

TUNE: WALKING IN THE DARK (MIX)

COOPER
What did you see that night? The night Laura Palmer was killed.

LOG LADY
Sshhh, (pats the log) I'll do the talking. Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. Many things were blocked. Laughing. Two men, two girls. Flashlights pass by in the woods over the ridge. The owls were near. The dark was-was pressing in on her. Quiet then. Later, footsteps. One man pass by. Screams far away. Terrible, terrible. One voice.

COOPER
Man or girl?

LOG LADY
Girl. Further up, over the ridge. The owls were silent.

TUNE: WALKING IN THE DARK (MIX)




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

DEPUTY HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and DR. HAYWARD are again hiking in the woods. HAWK leads the way and DR. HAYWARD still follows several paces behind. A woodpecker pecking and a raven cawing can be heard.

SONG: INTO THE NIGHT

COOPER
The two girls were Laura and Ronette.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The two men Jacques ... maybe Leo.

COOPER
Maybe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who's the third man?

HAWK stops and they all follow suit.

HAWK
Do you hear it?

They all hear a song drifting through the air.

HAWK
(points) This way.




CUT TO:

EXT. PERCHED RAVEN - DAY

We watch a raven, perched high on a tree top, fly off.

We view the front of the cabin. It looks exactly like the one in the photograph.




CUT TO:

RAVEN

We view a CLOSEUP of a raven's eye. We ZOOM OUT as we hear the song.

SONG LYRICS
Into the night. I cry out. I cry out your name.




CUT TO:

EXT. JACQUES RENAULT'S CABIN - DAY

They have come upon the cabin they were looking for. The cabin from the photograph in JACQUES apartment. Just below it, near a stone foundation, HAWK and TRUMAN point their guns at the ready. COOPER removes his gun from his holster. SHERIFF TRUMAN gives DR. HAYWARD a hand signal to stay put. DR. HAYWARD takes a seat on the ground to catch his breath as the rest move toward the cabin with their guns drawn.




CUT TO:

INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S CABIN - DAY

The song comes to an end but the record player, with an automated stylus, replays the song it has been playing. We watch HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER burst into the cabin with their guns drawn. They quickly scan the room, find it empty and puts their guns away before scattering throughout the cabin.

SONG LYRICS
Into the night. Shadows fall, shadows ...

COOPER moves to the record player. Using his tweezers he lifts the stylus from the record, puts it in its cradle and says ...

SONG ENDS: INTO THE NIGHT

COOPER
And there's always music in the air.

SHERIFF TRUMAN lifts the cover off an object, where a bird can be heard, and finds a mynah bird in its bird cage. The bird cage has a name plaque. He reads it out loud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Waldo.

DEPUTY HAWK has moved over to a camera on a tripod. He opens the camera.

HAWK
There's film in here.

Using a handkerchief, HAWK removes the film canister. We see COOPER put on some latex gloves and move to the floor to inspect a roll of twine. HAWK has now moved to another area and finds ...

HAWK
Blood.

A cuckoo clock go off but the cuckoo clock bird is not popping out like it should. SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to it, opens one of the little doors and a bunch of poker chips fall out. Kneeling on the floor, COOPER watches one of the poker chips roll under a chair. COOPER walks over to it and picks it up.

We view a sign above the double doors to the room. It says 'Timber Room'. We PAN down to see a couple, MR. and MRS. SCHOLPF, open the doors to the room. A HOSTESS, dressed in a Viking costume and wearing a Viking helmet, stands by the door to greet and check people into the party. Behind her we see the party being held to welcome the Icelandic business group to Twin Peaks.

MR. SCHOLPF
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Scholpf.

The HOSTESS looks over the sheet and nods for them to enter. CATHERINE MARTELL and PETE MARTELL are next to be greeted.

HOSTESS
Good evening.

CATHERINE
Catherine Martell and spouse.

PETE looks at her, bothered by the way she addressed him. They walk into the room.

PETE
Go easy on the sauce tonight okay Cathy.

CATHERINE immediately picks up two glasses of champagne from a nearby tray a waiter is holding. She downs one of the glasses, turns to PETE and says ...

CATHERINE
Couple of belts and even you may start to look good to me.

She walks off. PETE, in his good natured way, just smiles. He looks around the room.

At the buffet table MAJOR BRIGGS, as he serves himself food, speaks to the Icelandic business group leader, MR. EINAR THORSON.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Of course the modern age has changed forever the way your people live, Mr. Thorson. It would be my guess that there still remains a tremendous vestigial of interest in the legends and folklore of ancient Iceland.

MR. THORSON
Vestigial. Absolutely.

JERRY talks to HEBA, a tall, beautiful blonde, who stands against a log column holding a plate of food.

JERRY

JERRY
Did you realize the incredible potential that could result from our taking a mutual dip in each other's respective gene pools. (HEBA laughs) Heba, I want to cook for you.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER ROOM - NIGHT

In bursting laughter, we see BENJAMIN talking to several members of the Icelandic GROUP. From the bar, we see CATHERINE down another glass of champagne. She grabs another glass and walks over to him.

BENJAMIN
So he says. What do you get when you cross a Norwegian with a Swede? A socialist who wants to be king. (group laughs)

CATHERINE is now beside BENJAMIN, listening.

BENJAMIN
Well I can remember it was I think oh ... somewhere in the '50s I came ... (CATHERINE tries to get his attention by clearing her throat) I came through your country. Beautiful, beautiful. Not many trees though you know but ...

From her glass, CATHERINE pours a little bit of her champagne on BENJAMIN'S shoe. She gets his attention and group's as well as they all quiet down. BENJAMIN looks down at his shoe and taps his wet foot. He turns to look at CATHERINE and then back to the GROUP.

BENJAMIN
Would you excuse me.

GROUP
(severally) Of course ... yeah ... sure.

BENJAMIN and CATHERINE walk together away from the GROUP.

BENJAMIN
Meet me at my office. Give me uh ... two minutes to break away.

CATHERINE
Hell hath no fury.

BENJAMIN
What? Two minutes.

He walks away from her. We PAN to see AUDREY, leaning against a wood column. She has seen the incident with her father and CATHERINE. She watches CATHERINE walk down the hallway toward her father's office. We hear BENJAMIN in the background.

BENJAMIN
Ah, Thor. I've been meaning to ask you. Are you familiar with the work of Knut Hamsun?

She enters a small space within the walls between the hallway and the HORNE residency. Out of sight but in BENJAMIN HORNE'S office we hear BENJAMIN and CATHERINE as AUDREY moves within the small space to her spy hole. AUDREY removes a wood panel from the wall to reveal a knot hole in the wood wall in the other room.

BENJAMIN
We agreed. No scenes in front of the guests. Lets keep the melodrama to a minimum. The next thing I know your polishing my shoes with Dom Perigon. Fill me in. What's eating you?

We see AUDREY'S POV of CATHERINE speaking to BENJAMIN in his office.

CATHERINE
Why do you have this thousand poker chip from you know where in your pants yesterday? I thought you preferred women with a certain experience.

She holds it up for him to see. He takes the chip and looks it over as if he wasn't sure what it was.

BENJAMIN
Uhm. Jerry gave me that.

CATHERINE slaps him across the face with her right hand. We see AUDREY silently laugh.

BENJAMIN
Its a good luck charm. I thought I lost it. I'm so relieved ... that you found it.

CATHERINE slaps him across the face with her left hand.

BENJAMIN
Are you quite finished?

Again she slaps him across the face but with her right hand.

CATHERINE
Yes.

BENJAMIN
In that case.

BENJAMIN grabs her by the arms and kisses her. They both hug each other, kiss and CATHERINE lays back on his desk. AUDREY is no longer smiling as she watches them.

CATHERINE
Oh, lets burn the mill. Lets do it tonight.

BENJAMIN
No my love. We'll give Josie one last chance to sell, tomorrow. (moves off CATHERINE and stands up) Failing that, I have retained the services of a qualified professional.

BENJAMIN reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of mints and offers one to CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
Breath mint?

AUDREY replaces the wood slat cover. Disturbed by what she saw and heard, she laughs to herself.

PETE, holding a glass mug full of milk and wearing a napkin like a bib, talks to MR. THORSON, who is holding a plate of food.

PETE
Now let me get this straight. Your entire country is above the timber line.

They are interrupted as JERRY, using a microphone, gets the crowds attention. HEBA stands behind him in the background.

JERRY
Folks, ladies and gentlemen can I have your attention please.

SONG ENDS: ICELANDER IV

The singing stops and the crowd quiets down.

JERRY
Can I have your attention.

The microphone crackles. He taps it on a edge of a podium that generates some amplified distortion but it all clears up. JERRY laughs.

JERRY
First off, I want to thank you all for turning out to welcome our neighbors from the magical isle of Iceland. (says an Icelander sentence then repeats it in English) We are all Icelanders.

The crowd claps and JERRY laughs. We see LELAND in the crowd listening on.

JERRY
The Ghostwood Estates project is an important part of our future here in Twin Peaks and there's no one we'd rather ...

TUNE: IN THE MOOD   28K

As JERRY speaks, a big band tune unexpectedly and unintentionally starts up. People in crowd look around unsure of what is going on. We see that BENJAMIN and CATHERINE have returned to the party.

JERRY
... have as partners in our future then ... (looks around) What?

We view LELAND cringe and moan at hearing the big band tune. He irrationally begins to dance, holding his hands in place as if he was dancing with a partner. Alone on the dance floor, people start to look at him. BENJAMIN sees him and his furious. He doesn't want LELAND to upset or frighten his guests so he tells CATHERINE ...

BENJAMIN
Dance with him. (she gives him a questioning look) It is serious. Dance with him.

CATHERINE complies. She takes off her shoes, moves over to LELAND, grabs his hands and starts to dance with him. People watch them and several of them can be heard. BENJAMIN waves to JERRY to come over.

PARTY GUEST #1
Alright.

Confused, JERRY puts the microphone down and walks over to BENJAMIN.

PARTY GUEST #2
Jerry, what's going on?

PARTY GUEST #3
Yeah.

BENJAMIN
(to JERRY, now beside him) Get Jacoby, get a net but get him (points of LELAND) out of my life.

LELAND stops dancing but he puts his hands to his head and starts to cry. CATHERINE doesn't know what to do at first but, being a little drunk, mimics him by placing her hands to her head. With both hands on her head she starts to pat her head with both hands treating LELAND'S distress like some odd dance move. HEBA, dancing with JERRY, sees them and start to duplicate the dance. Soon everyone is doing it including BENJAMIN, who is dancing with a women from the Icelandic group. Behind a wood column, AUDREY cries at the sight of LELAND suffering on the dance floor.

In a truck, LEO parks, gets out and walks to the outside wall of his house. He lifts a latch that opens a storage compartment built into the outside wall. He pulls out two 5 gallon gasoline cans. He closes the storage doors, picks up the gas cans, walks over to his truck and puts them in. As he turns around, he is suddenly punched in the face, the stomach, again in the face and then is jerked to the ground. LEO, flat on his back, lays quietly as HANK, in a black leather jacket, stands over him grabbing at LEO'S jacket.

HANK
I told you to mind the store Leo not open your own franchise.

LEO
Hank I ...

HANK
Do as your told Leo. Next time, you watch me take your little chippy apart before I kill ya'.

HANK lets go of his jacket and walks away nearly stepping on his head. LEO coughs trying to catch his breath.

LEO walks inside through the kitchen entrance. As he enters we see that his face has been cut up and is a little bloody. He moves to the kitchen sink. SHELLY sees him and, shocked and concerned, rushes to him.

LEO

SHELLY
Honey what happened? Are you okay?

LEO
JUST GET ME A DAMN BEER! (shoves her to the ground)

SHELLY scrambles for the gun in the pocket of her robe. Still on the ground, she pulls it out, holds it securely between both of her hands and aims it at LEO.

LEO
Get up and ...

LEO sees her with the gun and nearly starts to laugh.

LEO
(smiling) What the hell are you doing with that?

SHELLY
Your not going to hurt me again. Don't touch me. Don't come near me Leo.

LEO
You stupid little SLUT!

SHELLY cocks the gun to fire by pulling the hammer back with her thumb.

LEO
You haven't got the guts.

LEO starts to move towards her. SHELLY closes her eyes and pulls the trigger. It discharges and hits LEO. Loudly, we hear LEO grunt like an animal in pain. SHELLY throws the gun to the floor, covers her eyes and cries out in fear. We hear the kitchen door slam shut.

COOPER takes a deep breath as he ponders what to say.

COOPER
What I want and what I need are two different things Audrey.

COOPER takes another deep breath.

COOPER
When a man joins the bureau he takes an oath to uphold certain values. Values that he’s sworn to live by. This is wrong Audrey, we both know it.

AUDREY
But don’t you like me?

COOPER
I like you very much. Your beautiful, intelligent, desirable. Your everything a man wants in his life. But what you need right now, more then anything else, is a friend. Someone who will listen.

AUDREY wipes tears from her eyes. COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handkerchief for her.

AUDREY
Friends huh.

COOPER nods yes. AUDREY brightens with a smile. COOPER returns with a smile.

COOPER
Now I’m going to go down and get us two malts and some fries downstairs. Then I want you to tell me all your troubles.

Near the table hanging from a stand is a bird cage with WALDO, the mynah bird, from JACQUES RENAULT’S cabin. AGENT COOPER walks into the room and stands near the window and the bird cage.

DR. HAYWARD
Alright I found it. Gracula Religiosa. Commonly known as the hill mynah. Native to Southeast Asia-Indonesia. Feeds on fruit mainly. Some invertebrates. Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah well so far we haven’t heard a peep.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks to the bird cage.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey Waldo what’s up.

DR. HAYWARD
Well it says here that mimicry is a kind of play with the mynah. But this one’s in a weakened condition; starved, dehydrated. I’d say he’s feeling anything but playful.

DR. HAYWARD picks up a grape.

DR. HAYWARD
Here ya’ go little fella.

DR. HAYWARD moves to feed the grape to WALDO but sees COOPER staring at the bird.

DR. HAYWARD
Oh, you wanna feed him Agent Cooper?

COOPER
I don’t like birds.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
When do you think he’ll start talking again?

DR. HAYWARD
Well, according to the book his urge to mimic should return with his good health.

COOPER
If it does then we got a witness.

DR. HAYWARD
Well we better keep feeding him.

DR. HAYWARD sourly looks at the grape and then turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

DR. HAYWARD
You got any apples?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. There’s some at the bottom of the fridge.

DR. HAYWARD
These grapes are right on the edge.

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL enters the room carrying a file.

HAWK
These just came in from your office.

HAWK hands the file to COOPER, who looks it over. COOPER moves over to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Hmm. Forensics confirms that Jacques Renault had three guests to his cabin; Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson.

COOPER looks at the back of a large photograph. The photograph is marked with a stamp as evidence. COOPER flips the photograph over to look at the image.

COOPER
This is the only exposed negative on that roll of film Harry. Look familiar?

COOPER hands the photo to SHERIFF TRUMAN. SHERIFF TRUMAN scans the photograph and smiles.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’s our Waldo.

COOPER
No Harry, the girl. That’s Laura.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gives a puzzled look and looks at the photograph again.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we view a CLOSE-UP of the photograph. The picture is of WALDO perched on the shoulder of a WOMAN with blonde hair.


BACK TO SCENE:

Unsure which end is up, SHERIFF TRUMAN turns the photograph around as he continues to look it over.

COOPER
Well, now we know who and when. We don’t know why.

COOPER stacks some books under the bird cage. COOPER then pulls his mini tape recorder out of his pocket and shows it to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Voice activated Harry.

With a CLICK, COOPER turns the mini recorder on.

COOPER
When the bird talks maybe we’ll get some answers.

COOPER places his mini tape recorder on the stack of books right below the bird cage. COOPER picks up a file from the folder and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN. Paper clipped to the file is a plastic bag containing the notched poker chip.

COOPER
Albert confirmed that this matches the fragment found in Laura’s stomach.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thousand dollar chip from One-Eyed Jacks.

HAWK
Jacques Renault’s working there. Dealing in the casino.

COOPER
Well, I think a little field work is in order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacks is over the border. A little out of our jurisdiction.

COOPER
Well I know that Harry. That’s why I was thinking this would be a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.

SHERIFF TRUMAN understands and smiles.

I guess I feel I can say anything. All my secrets. The naked ones. I know you like those doc. I know you like me too. That’ll be my little secret okay. Just like your coconut. Why is it so easy to make men like me? And I don’t even have to try very hard. Maybe ... if it was harder ...

AUDREY
Fruity.

CUSTOMER
As in fruit.

MR. EMORY BATTIS, the store vice-president, walks up to the perfume counter and talks to JENNY, a salesgirl working with AUDREY. AUDREY searches for another fragrance for the CUSTOMER but, standing near JENNY, is more interested in listening in on JENNY’S and BATTIS’S discussion.

EMORY
Could I see you in my office in five minutes?

JENNY
Sure.

EMORY walks off.

CUSTOMER
I’m not making myself clear. I want a scent that makes a statement.

AUDREY
Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck. Its a perfume, its a fashion accessory. Two statements for the price of one.

CUSTOMER
I don’t appreciate your attitude.

The CUSTOMER walks away.

JENNY
Wow, a unicorn.

EMORY
Jenny, you had a good time at the club last week didn’t you?

Yeah, yeah I had a great time, Mr. Battis.

SHELLY hands a customer their order of a cherry pie.

SHELLY

Oh you mean Ed.

Yeah Big Ed.

SHELLY
Yeah.

HANK
Yeah, I’m a little better at faces then names I guess.

The COOK rings the service bell and SHELLY moves off to pick up the order.

HANK
(sinisterly) Yeah, Big Ed.

HANK looks down at the counter where he sees a lighter someone had left behind their plate of food. With his shifty eyes, HANK glances around, casually moves his hand, picks up the lighter and puts it in his back pocket. HANK then moves the dirty plates to a bin.

At the front door, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER enter the diner. SHERIFF TRUMAN spots HANK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

Hi Harry. Glad to see me?

SHELLY moves to the coffee dispenser. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are still standing by the counter as they talk.

COOPER
Harry, I’m going to let you in on a little secret. Everyday, once a day, give yourself a present. Don’t plan it, don’t wait for it, just let it happen.

SHELLY places two cups of coffee on the counter near them.

COOPER
It could be a new shirt at the men store, a catnap in your office chair or ...

COOPER gestures to the cups of coffee on the counter before them.

COOPER
... two cups of good hot black coffee. Like this.

COOPER wears a large grin. SHERIFF TRUMAN grins back.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A present? Like Christmas?

COOPER nods yes. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN both move to the counter and take a seat where their coffee has been placed. COOPER grabs his cup and takes a sip. SHERIFF TRUMAN watches COOPER.

COOPER
Ahh man that hits the spot.

SHERIFF TRUMAN grins at COOPER’S reaction. SHERIFF TRUMAN hasn’t touched his cup yet. COOPER slides it over to him.

Now refresh my memory. What policy is this?

He pulls out an expanding folder from his briefcase and takes out a document.

Your new life insurance. Since the binder takes effect at midnight tonight I really had no choice. You see, it just couldn’t wait until tomorrow.

He pulls a pen from his shirt pocket, clicks out the pen tip, marks an ‘X’ by the line for her to sign by and hands her the pen.

Are you suggesting that there’s something ... irregular at work here?

MR. NEV
I certainly never got that idea from Mrs. Packard, no. Or from Mr. Horne for that matter either. When he offered to collect your signatures I thought it was fine. Just with a new account, I like to be certain to (gestures with the pen as if to cross a ‘T’) cross every ‘T’.

Again he shows her where to sign on the document.

MR. NEV
Right here please.

CATHERINE
You know, I’m noticing that there’s some ... minor changes that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft. I think what I’d like to do is go over this with him on the phone in the morning, and initial the changes and get the completed documents to you at that time.

As she does, she spots a new hotel guest, a thin ASIAN MAN, being helped to his room by a BELL BOY. As she passes him, the ASIAN MAN bows his head to her.

BIG ED opens a briefcase laying on the table. Inside the briefcase we see several moustaches and wigs.

BIG ED
Wow, look at all this.

We PAN to see AGENT COOPER and HAWK. COOPER lets out an ‘ouch’ as HAWK applies tape to a microphone wire on his upper left arm.

HAWK
Sorry.

We ZOOM out to see them all.

COOPER
There’s a curly haired wig in there Ed. It’s gonna work like gangbusters ... and I’ll help you out with one of those moustaches.

BIG ED
Think it’ll fit? I’ve got a big head.

HAWK finishes installing COOPER microphone.

HAWK
Okay, give it a try.

BIG ED moves the curly wig to his head to try it on. COOPER rolls his long sleeve shirt down, lifts his wrist near to his mouth and says ...

COOPER
Testing one two.

The speaker from the receiver duplicates what he says but ends with a very loud swoop of distortion from over amplification. COOPER grabs his wrist and all remain silent.

With their guns drawn, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER meet in the hallway near the door to the conference room. They enter the conference room and lower their guns as they see what was shot, WALDO. DEPUTY HAWK, DEPUTY ANDY, BIG ED and LUCY follow behind them.

BIG ED

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo. Ah geez.

ANDY
Poor Waldo.

COOPER picks up his mini tape recorder that was set to automatically record on voice activation. He rewinds the tape a bit and plays it. From the tape recorder we hear ...

BIG ED

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo.

COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it some more and hits play. We hear ...

LUCY
Birdie birdie birdie. Want some orange? Come on lets share.

LUCY, standing by the window with ANDY, looks away slightly embarrassed. Again COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it and hits play. This time we hear ...

COOPER and BIG ED return the stare as she walks by.

COOPER
Casino’s probably in the back. If Jacques dealing that’s where we’ll find him.

The Icelander group leave the room. JERRY, holding a very large pine cone in his left hand, takes a seat on BEN’S desk.

JERRY

JERRY puts the pine cone down on BEN’S desk, grabs the tub of ice cream and a spoon and starts eating.

Uh-huh. Yeah. So, what’s the catch?

BEN and JERRY are now both spooning out ice cream from the same tub.

JERRY
More fun. Signing party. They wanna finalize the deal at One-Eyed Jacks.

BEN pulls the tub of ice cream away from JERRY as he moves his spoon towards it.

Ahh. Jerry, Jerry. Get ’em back on the van. (nods and smiles)

JERRY

JERRY throws his spoon in the tub of ice cream and picks up his mug of beer. As JERRY walks toward the door he trips on a step but regains his balance. He looks at BEN and laughs at himself.

JERRY

From the next room the Icelander group can be heard yelling.

AUDREY lifts the cherry to her mouth, bites the cherry off and eats it while still holding onto the cherry stem. Next, she puts the cherry stem into her mouth. Her eyes roll and her lips squirm as she contorts her tongue into weaving the cherry stem into a knot. Finished, she pulls out the knotted stem and places it on the napkin the drink was on.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO: ROULETTE WHEEL

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

As the last scene, the TIGHT FOCUS on DR. JACOBY’S left eye, FADES OUT we FADE IN to FOCUS on a top view of a spinning roulette wheel. A white marble is dropped in and bounces around for a while until it stops in a marked crevice.

DEALER (OFF SCREEN)
Red 36.

BACK TO SCENE:

Beside the roulette table stands ‘BIG’ ED HURLEY dressed in his undercover garb of a western outfit, wig and moustache. Standing next to him is one the establishments 52‘ PICK-UPS, a hospitality girl.

52 PICK-UP #1
Sorry Mister, I guess our date’s off.

BIG ED shrugs and walks away from the roulette table. People can be heard placing bets and laughing. BIG ED passes FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER as he walks through the casino. AGENT COOPER is seated at a Black Jack table. JACQUES RENAULT is the dealer. We FOCUS on COOPER and JACQUES as BIG ED walks off. JACQUES speaks with a slight French-Canadian accent.

JACQUES
Sir are you absolutely sure you want another card?

COOPER
Yes please.

JACQUES pulls another card from the deck and places it face up, the deuce of hearts. COOPER flips over his one card laying face down to reveal that he has ...

COOPER
Twenty-one. Can you beat that?

JACQUES turns his one card laying face down to reveal a pair of kings for 20. COOPER wins the hand.

COOPER
Mother always said I was born lucky.

JACQUES shuffles the deck as a 52’ PICK-UP #2, walks up to COOPER, cups her hand around his ear and whispers something. COOPER reaches up and places a poker chip in her hand.

COOPER
Maybe later. Thanks for asking.

She purses her lips and walks off. JACQUES grins and moves his eyebrows up and down with a gesture to the woman.

COOPER
This is for you.

COOPER slides a poker chip on the table towards JACQUES. The poker chip is a thousand dollar chip with a notch in it, the chip from his cabin. JACQUES looks it over and his eyes brighten.

COOPER
I’m a friend of Leo’s.

JACQUES
Who’s Leo?

COOPER
Buy you a cocktail Jacques?

Two video surveillance monitors sit side-by-side on the corner of a BLACKIE’S desk. One of the monitors is trained on COOPER at a Black Jack table.

Seated at her office desk, BLACKIE ‘THE BLACK ROSE’ O’REILLY is playing a hand of solitaire.

BLACKIE’S office door opens and two of the establishment ‘52’ PICK-UPS’ enter and take positions beside the door as they escort AUDREY HORNE inside.

BLACKIE
Come in.

AUDREY walks inside wearing white lingerie decorated with little red print bows, white stockings and supporters, white shoes and a small, lacy coat.

BLACKIE
Turn around.

AUDREY complies and turns around.

Listening in on the conversation from the microphone planted on AGENT COOPER, we see DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL wearing headphones and seated around recording equipment. BIG ED is seated beside him in the van. We can hear the conversation between COOPER and JACQUES from the recording equipment.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Jacques, how long have you been dealing Black Jack?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
Long enough to spot a card counter.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Do you always let card counters buy you a drink?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
I don’t see tips like that every day.



CUT TO:

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

Seated at a small table in a corner of the casino, we see AGENT COOPER talking to JACQUES.

COOPER
Leo ever mention me to you?

Before he answers, JACQUES stares at a WAITRESS as she bends down towards them and then walks away.

JACQUES
I don’t know Mister. Who are you?

COOPER
I can’t believe Leo never told you about me.

JACQUES
Or maybe he did. I don’t know.

COOPER
Leo played you like a violin. Had you and your brother taking all the risk running the product across the border. Never cut you in on a piece of the action.

JACQUES
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

COOPER
Take that chip out of your pocket and take a look at it. Go ahead. That chip is a special significance. A very special night you spent up at your cabin. Here’s a clue.

COOPER mimics WALDO the mynah bird.

COOPER
Laura, Laura.

JACQUES remembers and quickly tries to leaves his seat. Being calm, COOPER holds JACQUES’S arm down to keep him from scampering away.

COOPER
Take it easy, take it easy. How do you think a low rent hump like Leo’s been financing this little operation.

JACQUES
You?

COOPER
I’m the bank.

JACQUES
He never mentioned your name.

COOPER
Of course not. Leo makes the buy with my cash. You and your brother mule it across theborder. Did he ever tell you who was distributing state-side?

JACQUES
Naw. Some high school kid. That’s all I know.

COOPER
That’s right. We’re in sync now Jacques can you feel it? Can you?

JACQUES grins.

JACQUES
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

COOPER
Good. Cause I got a job for you across the border tonight. No Leo. No middle man.

COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fold of cash.

COOPER
Its ten grand. Half now, half on completion. How’s that sound?

JACQUES snatches the wad of cash from COOPER’S hand.

JACQUES
Sounds good. What are we doing?

COOPER
You meet me at the water processing plant on Black Lake in two hours. Is that going to be a problem?

JACQUES
No, no problem.

COOPER
Good.

JACQUES downs the rest of his beer.

COOPER
One more question Jacques. You know, Leo told me all about that night up at the cabin with the girls. I’m curious about the chip. How’d that happen?

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

JACQUES LAUGHS slightly.

JACQUES
It was that crazy bird.

COOPER
Bird?

JACQUES
It had a thing for Laura. Saying her name all the time like he’s in love or something. So we’re all partying, girls are all getting pretty high, everybody’s pretty crazy.

COOPER
You, Laura and Ronette.

JACQUES
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.

JACQUES LAUGHS.

JACQUES
Laura, she’s all tied up. Oh, she liked that. The bird, he starts pecking on her shoulder. Pecking like love pecks or something, ...

JACQUES LAUGHS again.

JACQUES
... you know what I mean. So Leo, he’s doing a number on her and Laura she’s screaming about that damn bird.

CLOSE ON: JACQUES MOUTH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of JACQUES mouth as he speaks. The scene is SLOW-DOWNED.

JACQUES
So Leo takes out a chip puts it in her mouth and says bite the bullet baby, bite the bullet.

JACQUES LAUGHS.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
Thanks for clearing that up.

JACQUES
Yeah, no problem.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

COOPER
See you on the other side.

From a viewpoint in the back seat, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY talk as they wait for JACQUES to fall into their trap. Through the front window, the factory surroundings are dark.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

ANDY
As we say in the law enforcement game, its a cold trail.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ahhhhhh women.

Over the police radio we hear DEPUTY HAWK.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)

SHERIFF TRUMAN picks up the microphone to reply.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

In the distance, a car drives up.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
He’s down stream about ten minutes. He’ll probably miss the catch but he’ll be there when we grill him.


BACK TO SCENE:

Directly ahead, the car comes to a stop and parks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Copy that. We’ll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins.

JACQUES RENAULT steps out of the car.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ready Andy?

ANDY
Ready Harry.

DISTANT VIEW POINT:

From a distance, TRUMAN’S police cruiser starts up and its police lights and siren turn on as it quickly accelerates. Another police cruiser, a backup unit, follows right behind them.


BIRD’S EVE VIEW:

We now get an OVERHEAD view as TRUMAN’S cruiser and the backup unit race toward JACQUES’S car. A third police cruiser, manned by DEPUTY FRED and DEPUTY #1, are also driving toward JACQUES’S car but opposite TRUMAN’S cruiser. Together they box JACQUES’S car in.


BACK TO SCENE:

Completely off guard, JACQUES spins around and attempts getting into his car but SHERIFF TRUMAN slams his brakes, jumps out of his cruiser, points his gun and yells.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
JACQUES! KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE ’EM! PUT ’EM ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR NOW!

FRED
YOU HEARD HIM!

DEPUTY #1
Cuff him!

DEPUTY FRED moves behind JACQUES to cuff him. SHERIFF TRUMAN puts his gun in its holster.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You’re under arrest ... for the attempted murder of Ronette Pulaski and the murder of Laura Palmer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns away from JACQUES and heads toward his police cruiser. DEPUTY FRED struggles with JACQUES to cuff his hands together.

FRED
Give me the other hand. Give me your other hand!

JACQUES throws his right elbow into FRED’s gut. JACQUES frees himself of FRED’s grip and reaches for the gun on FRED’s belt as he bends forward in pain. JACQUES grabs the gun, grips it with both hands and aims it toward SHERIFF TRUMAN.

FRED
HE’S GOT MY GUN!

DEPUTY #1
HARRY LOOK OUT!

SHERIFF TRUMAN spins around. A shot RINGS out. JACQUES RENAULT gets hit in the shoulder and falls to the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN is stunned as he sees JACQUES fall. TRUMAN turns his head and sees ANDY forcibly poised as he points his gun toward JACQUES. DEPUTY HAWK and BIG ED have just arrived in the white van. HAWK rushes over to JACQUES.

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
My shoulder.

Stunned, TRUMAN stands blank faced.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Andy?

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
Better call an ambulance.

ANDY
Are you okay Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(stunned) Yeah.

In the background, DEPUTY HAWK stands next to JACQUES. BIG ED helps DEPUTY FRED.

HAWK
Shut up. You’re all right.

ANDY
Better call that ambulance.

HAWK
You have the right to remain silent.

Staring at ANDY, SHERIFF TRUMAN is still stunned.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

We FOCUS on the reflection of a suitcase full of cash. A wrapped bundle of bills is thrown into the case. We ZOOM out to see HANK JENNINGS close the suitcase. We ZOOM out further to see JOSIE PACKARD leaning against the cabinet beside HANK.

HANK
Its all here. You’re very generous Josie. Sitting in that concrete box all that time, ninety grand seemed like all the money in creation. Kept me going. Its ... funniest thing, back in the world, I don’t know, ...

HANK lifts and bobs the suitcase up and down.

HANK
... it seems kinda’ light.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

JOSIE walks away from HANK and over to the kitchen counter. JOSIE lights up a cigarette. HANK follows JOSIE to the counter.

HANK
Oh I’ve been going over this in my mind and ... see if you can follow my thinking. We’re all born into life and we have a certain number of years to move and breathe and have our vein. That’s from a book on oriental philosophy I read when I was in the joint. And maybe somebody, somewhere, knows how much time we have. I don’t, do you?

JOSIE blows her cigarette smoke into HANK’S face. HANK belligerently breathes it in deeply.

HANK
So, when a man gives up a certain portion of his life, eighteen months for instance. How does he place a value on that time? Eighteen months, ninety thousand, what’s that? Uh, five thousand a month. Well that’s not bad if you’re going to live another forty or fifty years but what if you only got another twenty or ten ... or some unforeseen event kills you tomorrow. As in the case of the boating accident that killed your late husband Andrew.

JOSIE moves into the living room. HANK follows her. In the background, behind HANK, is a deer head trophy. The horns of the trophy align with HANK’S head making it appear that the horns are sprouting from his head.

HANK
Or say, you just got out of prison. Where you went in for vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement to avoid being implicated in the commission of a much greater crime, murder. For which in fact you were responsible. But now there’s this threat, this possible threat, that ... this fact could be discovered ... and in one stroke, ten or fifteen or twenty more years of your life could be cut right off from underneath you. So I’ve been asking myself. What does that do to the market value of eighteen months?

JOSIE turns around to face HANK.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

She walks back to the kitchen counter. Again, HANK follows her.

MUSIC: HANK’S THEME    39K

HANK
And we still do sweetheart. Signed, sealed, delivered ... and I want to take care of everything we agreed to. You see, you want a lot for your money ... and I want a lot for my time. You know there’s a saying in the joint. Its not oriental philosophy but it has a similar kind of logic that appeals to my uh ...

JOSIE tries to walk away from him but HANK grabs her arms and turns her around to face him.

HANK
... spiritual nature.

HANK grabs JOSIE’S right hand and clasps her fingers with the fingers on his right hand with their thumbs sticking up.

HANK
Once you’re in business with somebody you’re in business for life, like a marriage.

Using his left hand, HANK pulls out a switch blade knife and clicks it open with a push of a button. HANK moves the blade to JOSIE’S thumb and gently slashes it. JOSIE writhes slightly in pain as blood oozes out of the cut. Next, HANK slashes his own thumb. HANK then presses his bleeding thumb against JOSIE’S.

HANK
Partner.

HANK releases his grip, moves his cut thumb to his mouth and licks the blood off with a smack. JOSIE trembles in fear. HANK walks off and leaves. JOSIE, still trembling, moves her thumb to her mouth and wipes the blood on her red lips.

From the open door of the office, two MILL WORKERS watch CATHERINE as she tosses the files around. PETE MARTELL walks up to the open office door to see what the commotion is all about. PETE throws a questioning glance to one of MILL WORKERS.

CATHERINE
Damn. Where? Where is it?

PETE steps into the office.

PETE

Holding files, CATHERINE turns to face PETE.

CATHERINE

PETE closes the door behind himself.

PETE
Well don’t you keep it in that little safe at home?

CATHERINE
No, its not in the safe at home. Its not here. Its not anywhere. Tell me you didn’t take it?

PETE shrugs.

PETE
I didn’t take it.

CATHERINE
Pete, tell me the truth. You’re not helping her to pull something here.

PETE notices that the two MILL WORKERS are still watching them. PETE moves to close the horizontal blind to the window they are using to peer inside.

PETE
Who?

CATHERINE
Josie.

PETE
Oh no.

PETE moves to close another horizontal blind to a window that the two nosy MILL WORKERS have moved to.

PETE
Pull what here?

CATHERINE
Oh Peter. Forget everything that we’ve ever said or done to hurt each other.

PETE
Just like that.

PETE closes another horizontal blind.

Temporarily. I know our marriage is a living train wreck but there used to be something caring between us. The fella who caught my eye. The lumber jack that ... could scamper up a tree like a ... cat.

PETE becomes tearyed eyed.

PETE
I know things haven’t been easy for ya’.

CATHERINE
Peter, somewhere under all that scar tissue there’s the faintest flicker of what we used to feel for each other. I’m asking you to feel that now.

PETE
Why? Exactly.

CATHERINE
(emotional) Because I’m in trouble ... and given what I’ve become and the way I’ve treated people there’s no one else I can turn to. I need your help.

PETE listens on with tears in his eyes. PETE rushes over to CATHERINE and gives her a big hug.

PETE
Oh Catherine. Catherine.

CATHERINE rolls her eyes and gently pats his back.

BIG ED
So, Fred starts to put the cuffs on him right. Now Harry, he turns to go. Now all of a sudden Jacques throws an elbow at Fred like this.

BIG ED visually shows the group the move JACQUES made.

BIG ED
Wham!

LUCY, with her back to group, is listening as she waters some plants in the reception area.

HAWK
And in one move he takes Fred’s gun and he’s got the drop on Harry.

BIG ED
Harry is deader then a pound of road side stew.

HAWK
Then, all of a sudden, a single shot rings out.

ANDY puts his hands to together with his index fingers pointed out to resemble a gun and reenacts his shooting of JACQUES. ANDY includes the sound effect of the gun firing, ‘Paa-kehhh’. BIG ED, DEPUTY HAWK and the surrounding DEPUTIES clap and cheer him on.

HAWK
All right! Andy the man.

LUCY turns to look at ANDY. Their eyes meet. LUCY smiles, shyly turns away and quickly scampers into the coffee station.

BIG ED
Alright Andy.

HAWK pushes ANDY to talk to LUCY.

HAWK
Go ahead Andy. Give it your best shot. Go on.

ANDY tugs his belt up and walks to the coffee station. LUCY turns her head to look at ANDY and quickly turns her head away. ANDY turns around and closes the accordion doors of the coffee station for privacy. ANDY turns to LUCY, grabs her by the arms and turns her around to face him. Slowly, they move to kiss. ANDY and LUCY both puts their arms around each other as they longingly kiss each other. Still holding each other, LUCY and ANDY separate from the kiss to look at each other.

LUCY
Oh Andy.

ANDY
Oh Punky.

LUCY
I’m pregnant.

ANDY’S eyes widen. He remains silent. LUCY becomes irritated by his silence and expression. ANDY opens the doors to the coffee station, slowly walks out and moves down the hall. BIG ED and HAWK watch ANDY silently walk off.

HAWK
Uh-oh.

Carrying a watering pitcher, LUCY exits the coffee station and walks by HAWK and BIG ED. Angry, LUCY stares at HAWK and BIG ED and barks.

LUCY
Fresh ... coffee.

LUCY walks to her office. BIG ED and HAWK shake their heads and walk away. We PAN to see the other DEPUTIES also walk off. We ZOOM in on the reception window to LUCY’S office. In her office, LUCY’S telephone RINGS. Annoyed, LUCY rudely answers it.

Leo, the girls, they gooonnnne.

What about the train car?

Surprised by the question, COOPER looks at TRUMAN.

LOG LADY
Hello again. Can you see through a wall? Can you see through human skin? X-rays see through solid, or so-called solid objects. There are things in life that exist, and yet our eyes cannot see them. Have you ever seen something startling that others cannot see? Why are some things kept from our vision? Is life a puzzle? I am filled with questions. Sometimes my questions are answered. In my heart, I can tell if the answer is correct. I am my own judge. In a dream, are all the characters really you? Different aspects of you? Do answers come in dreams? One more thing: I grew up in the woods. I understand many things because of the woods. Trees standing together, growing alongside one another, providing so much. I chew pitch gum. On the outside, let’s say of the ponderosa pine, sometimes pitch oozes out. Runny pitch is no good to chew. Hard, brittle pitch is no good. But in between there exists a firm, slightly crusted pitch with such a flavor. This is the pitch I chew.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Can you hear me? Agent Cooper?

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME   

We FOCUS on the open doorway to COOPER’s room. A tall and thin man, an OLD WAITER, slowly walks into view carrying a tray with a glass of warm milk that COOPER had ordered. The OLD WAITER walks into the doorway and stops.

OLD WAITER
Room service.

CLOSE ON: COOPER’S FACE

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of AGENT COOPER’S face. With his eyes closed, COOPER’S eyes squirm and his lips move.


BACK TO SCENE:

Slowly the OLD WAITER, still holding the tray, walks up to COOPER. Standing beside him, the OLD WAITER bends slightly as he peers down at COOPER.

OLD WAITER
How ya’ doin’ down there?

COOPER moves his head slightly and cracks his eyes open to a small slit.

OLD WAITER
(smiling) Warm milk.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper?

COOPER
Would you put it on the table please. And would you call a doctor.

OLD WAITER
Sure.

The OLD WAITER slowly walks over to the telephone. The OLD WAITER puts the tray with the glass of milk down beside the phone. Annoyed, the OLD WAITER sternly looks at the phone as he hears ANDY constantly calling out.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Are you all right? Can you hear me? Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper?

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PHONE

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the telephone receiver.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Its Andy, can you hear me? Are you all right? Agent Cooper?

BACK TO SCENE:

Annoyed by the phone, the OLD WAITER shakes his head slightly. The OLD WAITER picks up the receiver and tries to hang up the phone by putting the receiver in its cradle.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Are you all right? Agent Cooper?

The OLD WAITER puts the receiver in the cradle crooked so it won’t hang up properly.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper? Its Andy. Its An ...

Fiddling with the receiver, the OLD WAITER pushes the receiver down until it contacts one of the switches that disconnects the call. The OLD WAITER slowly turns in place and bends over slightly to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
I hung it up for ya’.

COOPER slowly turns his head toward the OLD WAITER and opens his eyes slightly.

COOPER
What’s that?

OLD WAITER
Hung it up for ya’.

COOPER
Did you call the doctor?

The OLD WAITER gives COOPER a confused look.

COOPER
The doctor?

OLD WAITER
(confused) Uhhhh. Its hung up, the phone.

COOPER
Thank you.

OLD WAITER
Sure. No problem.

The OLD WAITER turns around and grabs a pen and a small pad of paper, the bill. The OLD WAITER turns back around, bends down and holds out the pen and the bill towards COOPER. COOPER raises his left hand and grabs the pen.

COOPER
Does this include a gratuity?

OLD WAITER
(smiles) Yes sir.

COOPER signs the tab.

OLD WAITER
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

The OLD WAITER straightens up. The OLD WAITER turns to look at the tray and then turns back to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
The milk will get cool on you. Pretty soon.

COOPER
Okay.

Smiling, the OLD WAITER slowly heads toward the door.

The OLD WAITER stops and turns to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
I’ve heard about you.

COOPER moves his head and opens his eyes slightly to look at the OLD WAITER. The OLD WAITER gives COOPER a thumbs up handsign. COOPER produces a tiny grin. The OLD WAITER winks at COOPER. Smiling, the OLD WAITER turns back to the door, slowly heads out of the room and out of view down the hallway.

COOPER looks at the ceiling.

A moment later the OLD WAITER returns and steps back inside the room.

OLD WAITER
(smiling) I’ve heard about you.

COOPER moves his head to look at the OLD WAITER. Again, the OLD WAITER gives COOPER a thumbs up handsign. COOPER slowly moves his left hand up and gives the OLD WAITER a thumbs up handsign also. Smiling, the OLD WAITER turns around, leaves the room and moves out of sight down the hallway.

Once again, the OLD WAITER returns to stand in the doorway. The OLD WAITER winks and flashes a thumbs up handsign. COOPER slowly lifts his left hand and waves at the OLD WAITER with his index finger. The OLD WAITER nods, winks, turns and walks off down the hall out of sight.

COOPER lays motionless on the floor. Suddenly, a RINGING can be heard.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

A ghostly apparition of a GIANT man walks into the room and stands beside COOPER. The GIANT loses his ghostly form and appears solid. The room becomes dark. A bright spotlight falls on COOPER and the GIANT.

GIANT
I will tell you three things.

COOPER’S eyes open slightly.

GIANT
If I tell them to you and they come true, then will you believe me?

COOPER
Who’s that?

GIANT
Think of me as a friend.

COOPER
Where do you come from?

The GIANT shakes his head gently from side-to-side.

GIANT
The question is, where have you gone? The first thing I will tell you is, there’s a man ... in a smiling bag.

COOPER
(repeats) Man in a smiling bag.

GIANT
Second thing is, the owls are not what they seem. Third thing is, without chemicals ... he points.

COOPER
What do these things mean?

GIANT
This is all I am permitted to say. Give me your ring. I will return it to you when you find these things to be true.

The GIANT bends down. COOPER raises his left hand. The GIANT grips COOPER’S hand and slowly removes his ring from COOPER’S pinkie finger.

GIANT
We want to help you.

COOPER
Who’s we?

GIANT
One last thing. Leo locked inside hungry horse. There’s a clue at Leo’s house.

The GIANT looks at COOPER’S bullet wound.

GIANT
You will require medical attention.

COOPER gently nods his head for yes. The GIANT returns into a ghostly apparition and disappears. The RINGING sound stops and the lights in the room return to normal.

I’m lying on the floor of my room. I’ve been shot.

BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
There’s a great deal of pain and a fair amount of blood. Fortunately I was wearing my bullet proof vest last night per bureau regulations when working undercover. I remember folding the vest up trying to chase down a wood tick. If you can imagine the impact on your chest of three bowling balls dropped from the height of about nine feet, you might began to approximate the sensation. All things considered, being shot is not as bad as I always thought it might be. As long as you can keep the fear from your mind. But I guess you can say that about almost anything in life. Its not so bad as long as you can keep the fear from your mind.

COOPER
At a time like this, curiously, you began to think of the things you regret or the things you might miss. I would like in general to treat people with much more care and respect. I would like to climb a tall hill. Not too tall. Sit in the cool grass. Not too cool. And feel the sun on my face. I wished I could have cracked the Lindburg kidnapping case. I would very much like to make love to a beautiful woman who I had genuine affection for. And of course, it goes without saying, that I would like to visit Tibet. I wish they could get their country back and the Dalai Lama could return. Oh I would like that very much. All in all, a very interesting experience.

At the open doorway, DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY lurch into firing positions with their guns drawn and scan the room.

COOPER
Harry, we need to get a search warrant for Leo Johnson’s house.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No need. Leo was shot in his own living room.

LUCY
Deputy Brennan found him.

DR. HAYWARD and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at LUCY because of her tone of voice. COOPER, in obvious pain, slowly sits himself up. DR. HAYWARD places a hand on COOPER’S right shoulder to try to stop him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER look at each other then back at ANDY.

SHERIFF TRUMAN notices something near ANDY and moves closer to investigate.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we view a cache that has been uncovered by the propped plank. Inside the cache is a bag of cocaine and a pair of black boots.


BACK TO SCENE:

SHERIFF TRUMAN bends down to the cache to get a closer look. COOPER stands right beside TRUMAN. TRUMAN looks towards ALBERT and yells out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey Albert, looks like you were more right then you know!

CUSTOMER
Hot damn that pie is good!

We PAN RIGHT, HANK JENNINGS clears a tabletop.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE, who sits alone at one of the booths in the diner. MADELEINE, wearing a pair of sunglasses, holds her pair of prescription eyeglasses in her hands. The bell for the entrance RINGS and MADELEINE looks towards the front door.

At the front door to the diner, we FOCUS on DONNA HAYWARD as she enters the diner. We FAVOR ON DONNA as she walks over to the booth where MADELEINE is seated. DONNA takes a seat opposite MADELEINE and removes her coat. MADELEINE removes her sunglasses.

MADELEINE
Here’s Laura’s glasses that you wanted.

MADELEINE hands the sunglasses to DONNA.

DONNA
Thanks.

DONNA looks at the sunglasses and then puts it on. DONNA peers around the diner through the sunglasses and then takes it off.

DONNA
Thanks.

MADELEINE puts her prescription eyeglasses on.

MADELEINE
Donna, do you see these glasses that I’m wearing?

DONNA
Yeah.

MADELEINE removes her eyeglasses and bends them at the nose bridge, breaking them.

MADELEINE
I hate them. I’m never wearing these again.

DONNA grabs herself a cigarette.

DONNA
Okay.

MADELEINE
Is it true about James?

Using a lighter, DONNA lights her cigarette.

DONNA
He spent the night in jail.

MADELEINE
Do you think its because of what we did?

DONNA
Look, we don’t know if we did anything. My dad said Jacoby got sick because he was attacked. All we did was send him a tape.

MADELEINE
Maybe he wouldn’t have been attacked if we hadn’t.

DONNA
Maybe, maybe the sun won’t come up tomorrow if you wash your hair. Think like that and you’re going to go crazy. What’s done is done. The only way this won’t come back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened last night. I can assure you James is doing the same thing.

DONNA takes a drag from her cigarette.

DONNA
Get the picture.

MADELEINE
(straight faced) Loud and clear.

MADELEINE changes her expression and her eyes widen.

MADELEINE
Uncle Leland’s hair ... turned white.

DONNA
Really?

MADELEINE nods her head for yes.

MADELEINE
White as a sheet.

DONNA
Weird.

NORMA JENNINGS walks up to their booth.

NORMA
Donna, I have something for you. Came here to the Double R yesterday.

NORMA hands DONNA an envelope.

DONNA
Thanks Norma.

DONNA opens the letter and reads the note to herself.

DONNA
God.

MADELEINE
What is it?

DONNA places the note on the table and slides it towards MADELEINE.


MADELEINE’S POV:

LOOK INTO THE MEALS ON WHEELS

MADELEINE (OFF SCREEN)
Look into the meals ...

Puzzled, MADELEINE and DONNA stare at each other.

In a nearby booth, we FOCUS on the ‘LOG LADY’. Seated with a cup of coffee before her on the table, the LOG LADY holds her log in her arms and chews heavily on pine tree pitch gum. Abruptly and unexpectedly, the LOG LADY spits out her gum onto the table. The LOG LADY picks the gum up and presses it onto the wall beside the booth. The LOG LADY takes a drink of her coffee then reaches into her pocket, retrieves a new piece of gum, puts it in her mouth and starts to chew again.

ALBERT
How simple can I make it Cooper. FBI agent gets shot, FBI agent investigates. I’m in proximity working the Seattle lab. I’m familiar with the underlying case.

Working around his rib cage, ALBERT touches a sensitive spot. COOPER GRUNTS in pain.

ALBERT
Does that hurt?

COOPER
Yes. Albert the point is you’re not going to win any local popularity contests.

ALBERT
No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.

ALBERT puts a stethoscope, that’s been hanging around his neck, to his ears and applies the probe to COOPER chest.

ALBERT
Breathe.

Slowly and with some pain, COOPER takes a deep breath.

ALBERT
Again.

COOPER complies and takes another breath.

ALBERT
Okay.

ALBERT removes his stethoscope and places it on top of his metal suitcase.

ALBERT
You were shot by a right handed person, five foot six to five foot ten inches tall at a distances of less then three feet. I’ll have ballistics later this afternoon. You’re still blank on the other details?

COOPER
Yes.

ALBERT
What was your vest doing riding up like that?

COOPER
Wood tick.

ALBERT looks away and exhales heavily.

ALBERT
Meanwhile one of your principle suspects is killed in his hospital bed and the other is shot in his living room. You tell me, vigilantly justice or just clean country living?

COOPER
Albert, where does this attitude of general unpleasantness come from?

ALBERT
I’ll have to get back to you on that.

COOPER
Well if you don’t want two black eyes on a regular basis I suggest you make some kind of peace with rural life.

ALBERT
(smartass) Great. After the square dance maybe we can all take a hayride.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

COOPER
Come in.

DEPUTY ANDY enters the room, closes the door behind himself and walks up to COOPER.

COOPER
Andy, how’s the nose?

ANDY
(smiling) Not a mark on it, only blood squirted out.

ALBERT
(smartass) Where do they keep his water dish?

COOPER quickly turns to glare at ALBERT.

COOPER
(straight faced) Albert.

ANDY
Agent Cooper, guess what, I have the answer to the riddle that you told me this morning. I called Hungry Horse Montana. The word locked, Leo Johnson was locked in a jail in Hungry Horse Montana.

COOPER
When Andy?

ANDY searches his shirt pockets, his front pants pockets and then his back pants pockets where he finds his notepad. ANDY flips through a few pages of the pad and then reads outloud:

ANDY
February nine, 1988.

COOPER and ALBERT looks at each other and simultaneously say:

COOPER and ALBERT
Teresa Banks.

COOPER
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night Teresa Banks was murdered. Good work Andy.

ANDY smiles brightly. ALBERT looks at ANDY.

ALBERT
(smartass) Yeah, woof.

ANDY losses his smile as he looks at ALBERT. COOPER scournfully looks at ALBERT then turns to ANDY and nods to him. ANDY cracks a slight smile.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

JAMES

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A red corvette, Leo Johnson.

COOPER holds his hand out.

JAMES
How?

JAMES stands up and digs into his pant’s pocket to get the necklace.

JAMES
Well this was in Jacoby’s office.

JAMES hands the necklace to COOPER. SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up.

JAMES
It was in a coconut.

COOPER moves a little closer to JAMES to verify his response.

COOPER
A coconut?

COOPER quickly looks at TRUMAN then moves to look at HAWK.

COOPER
Hawk take James back to his cell.

HAWK complies. JAMES leaves the room with HAWK right behind him.

COOPER
Jacoby?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How did you know he had the necklace?

COOPER
Laura and James were in love. I figured he had to have the other half of the necklace but if he had the other half of the necklace he would have given it to us to help with the case. Then it dawned on me. Something or someone frightened him off. He had to have it so I asked him for it.

COOPER shakes his head.

COOPER
Jacoby? I didn’t figure he had anything to do with this at all.

I smoke every once in a while. Helps me relieve tension.

SHELLY
Bobby, I was so afraid. Leo tried to kill me. He knows about us. He took me up to the mill. He tied me up and started the fire. Bobby, he told me he was going to kill you.

BOBBY
Fat chance. I won’t let him hurt us any more. Are you alright?

SHELLY
Doctors seem to think so.

BOBBY
You know Shelly, hospitals are dangerous places. First of all, they're crawling with sick people. And second of all, that food can kill you.

SHELLY and BOBBY chuckle.

BIG ED
Well, all I can do is sit here. Thinking about the things I should have said or done.

Ed, don’t be too hard on yourself.

BIG ED

ALBERT

Albert, I would like to speak to Ed.

Albert I’ll buy you a cup’a coffee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and ALBERT walk to a nearby coffee station just across from the couch. COOPER and BIG ED take a seat on the couch.

BIG ED
I saw this coming. I didn’t want to believe it. What’s worse is I’m sitting here thinking that maybe that there’s a part of me that ... didn’t want to stop her. And that’s a full load.

COOPER
When did you get married Ed?

ALBERT, after having just taken a drink and finding it distasteful, looks into his coffee cup and then to SHERIFF TRUMAN. TRUMAN is pouring himself a cup of coffee.

BIG ED
Right out of high school. Norma and I had been together about four years. Everybody figured we get hitched. That be that. I barely knew Nadine to say hello to.

ALBERT puts his cup of coffee aside, unable to drink it.

BIG ED
That spring, one bad weekend, Norma ran off with Hank. I was so twisted up inside I couldn’t see straight. When I opened my eyes there was Nadine right in front of me. There was something so sweet, so helpless about her. We drove all night. Ended up in some little town in Montana, out past Great Falls, and I asked her to marry me; half jokin’, half drunk, half crazy. It was light before we found the justice of the peace. Norma, well she hadn’t even slept with Hank. The look on her face when she found out. Nadine and I, we went up to my dad’s old cabin up in Eagle Pass. Honeymoon. I was hoping maybe we’d get to talking about a divorce, annulment, something.

SHERIFF TRUMAN listens on but ALBERT is obviously bored with the story.

BIG ED
But Nadine was so happy. And you know by golly ... I shot out Nadine’s eye on that honeymoon.

ALBERT’S eyes brighten up with interest.

COOPER
What do you mean Ed?

BIG ED
Well the first day we were hunting pheasant. Nadine’s a crack shot and we already had a couple of birds. And I felt good shooting. Listening to the sound echoing, roll down those hills. I fired and ... a piece of buckshot skipped off a rock and caught Nadine square in the eye.

COOPER
Man, that’s a tough one.

BIG ED
She laid across my lap as we drove back to town.

ALBERT starts to silently laugh. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at ALBERT. ALBERT tries to compose himself.

BIG ED
She never cried. She never blamed me. She never hated me for it.

COOPER sternfully looks at ALBERT. ALBERT pulls out a hankerchief for the tears the laughing has produced in his eyes.

BIG ED
Couple of months later Norma married Hank. So I don’t believe in fate. You make your bed, you sleep in it.

PETE MARTELL, wearing a hospital gown, sits back in a hospital bed with an oxygen breathing tube at his nose. A cart with a food tray with bins of green and yellowish goo is positioned before him. PETE moves himself to sit up, leans to the tray and sniffs the air above the goo. Unable to smell anything, PETE removes the oxygen breathing tube from his nose, moves closer to the goo and takes a big whiff.

PETE
Ughhh!

PETE is immediately repulsed and gags for air. PETE quickly repositions the oxygen tube to his nose and breathes deeply.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Rocks and bottles?

COOPER
Chalk and blackboard will be just fine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jelly donuts?

COOPER
Harry, that goes without saying.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk off.

We FOCUS on an open doorway as NORMA backs out of SHELLY’S hospital room. NORMA stands in the doorway as she speaks to SHELLY.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Son.

BOBBY turns and see his father seated at a booth. BOBBY tries to hide his cigarette.

BOBBY
Dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Would you ... care to join me?

With a slight sigh, BOBBY puts out his cigarette by snuffing it out in an ash tray on the counter.

BOBBY
Okay.

BOBBY walks over to the booth where his father is seated and lays out on the open bench opposite his father. Along with a cup of coffee, MAJOR BRIGGS is eating a slice of pie.

MAJOR BRIGGS
How was school today?

BOBBY is surprised by the question.

MAJOR BRIGGS
That’s classified.

BOBBY
Oh.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie? The huckleberries are particularly delicious today. Particularly fresh and delicious.

BOBBY
No thanks.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby, may I share something with you?

BOBBY
Okay.

MUSIC: VISION OF YOU

MAJOR BRIGGS
A vision I ... had in my sleep last night. As distinguished from a dream which is mere ... sorting and cataloging of the day’s events by the subconscious. This was a vision. As clear as a mountain stream. The mind revealing itself to itself. In my vision I was on a veranda of a ... vast estate, a palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to emanate from it ... a light from within this ... gleaming, radiant marble. I’d known this place. I ... I in fact had been born and raised there. This was my first return. A reunion with the ... deepest well springs of my being.

BOBBY listens on but is a little bored.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Wandering about I noticed happily that the house had been immaculately maintained. There’d been added a number of additional rooms but ... in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction one would never detect any difference. Returning to the house’s grand foyer, came a knock on the door. My son was standing there.

BOBBY’S attention is grabbed.

MAJOR BRIGGS
He was happy and care free. Clearly living a life of ... deep harmony and joy. We embraced. Warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision ended and I awoke with a ... tremendous feeling of ... optimism and confidence in ... you and your future. That was my vision of you.

BOBBY has been listening intently and is now teary eyed.

BOBBY
Really?

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m so .. glad to have had this opportunity to share it with you.

MAJOR BRIGGS stands up.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I wish you nothing but ... the very best in all things.

MAJOR BRIGGS and BOBBY shake hands.

BOBBY
Thank you, dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
See you later. Call.

BOBBY
Okay.

MUSIC ENDS: VISION OF YOU

MAJOR BRIGGS walks off to the coat rack to collect his hat and coat.

At the counter, HANK turns towards MAJOR BRIGGS.

HANK
Major?

MAJOR BRIGGS turns to HANK.

HANK
How was the pie?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Exceptional, as always.

HANK salutes MAJOR BRIGGS. MAJOR BRIGGS exits the diner through the front door but as he does he passes NORMA, who enters the diner. NORMA enters the counter island. HANK faces NORMA directly.

HANK
How’s Shelly?

BOBBY overhears HANK and turns his head to look at him.

NORMA
I can’t talk right now.

NORMA passes HANK and walks straight into the kitchen. HANK yells to NORMA as she enters the kitchen.

HANK
Well how she’d like the flowers!

HANK turns and meets eyes with BOBBY. HANK throws his arms up showing his discord at NORMA’S lack of response. BOBBY waves to him an understanding. HANK throws the towel in his hand up, catches it and walks away. BOBBY recollects the events of the previous night ...


INSERT: BOBBY’S FLASHBACK

We view the contents of the events BOBBY experienced the previous night. Inside LEO JOHNSON’S house, A shot RINGS out. A bullet smashes through the window and sends LEO flying back onto the couch.

Through BOBBY’S POV we FOCUS on the bullet hole in the broken glass and then FOCUS outside on HANK, wearing a black leather jacket, standing outside as he looks towards the house. HANK walks off.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (0:00 - 1:00)

AGENT COOPER sets at the short end of the conference table. Seated near COOPER, on the long end of the table, is AGENT ALBERT followed by SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK. The table is set up with nearly six dozen varieties of donuts, two pots of coffee, a stack of napkins and paper cups. DEPUTY ANDY sit opposite of COOPER on the other short end of the table. LUCY stands in the corner near ANDY and alongside the chalkboard which has a drawing of the map of the town. A collection of all the evidence involved in the PALMER case lays on the table near ANDY.

COOPER
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it appeared she made two appointments. In her diary she had written, ‘nervous about meeting ‘J’ tonight.’ I now believe this was a reference to James Hurley. She was nervous because she planned to tell him she didn’t want to see him any more. Before she snuck out of the house she received a phone call.

ALBERT
We believe it was Leo Johnson making the second appointment for sometime later that night.

COOPER
Laura met James, was with him until 12:30 ...

COOPER grabs himself a jelly donut. We PAN RIGHT to view the spread of donuts on the table.

COOPER
... when at the intersection of Sparkwood and 21 she jumped from the bike and ran into the woods.

SUPERIMPOSE: PINE TREES

As we PAN RIGHT to view the spread of donuts an additional scene is SUPERIMPOSED. We also view pine trees being blown in the wind.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
We believe it was there that she met up with Jacques Renault, Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski. Together they drove to the foot of the trail leading to Jacques’s cabin. They climbed the trail. They were heard passing by the cabin of the Log Lady. They reached Jacques Renault’s cabin at approximately 1 am. Drugs and alcohol were consumed. Laura was tied up and had sexual relations with both Leo and Jacques.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: STREET INTERSECTION LIGHT

Along with the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts the SUPERIMPOSED scene of the blowing trees now gives way to a street intersection light that is showing red.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage and attacked Laura. Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques went outside and passed out. When he came to, Leo and the girls were gone. We believe Leo hiked back down the trail to his corvette alone, leaving the girls behind.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: TRAIN CAR

The SUPERIMPOSED scene of the street intersection light that is showing red gives way to an exterior view of the train car where some of the grisly evidence to the case was found. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
The reason being ... there was a third man.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Deputy Hawk found evidence of a third man outside the window of Jacques’s cabin.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: BLOODY FLOOR AND HAMMER

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes to a view inside the train car where a flashlight spot illuminate a bloody floor and hammer. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
The third man took Laura and Ronette to the train car where they were tied up. Laura for the second time, Ronette for the first.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Using a blunt object, the killer hit Ronette and knocked her unconscious. He must have been so intent on killing Laura he didn’t realize that ...

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: RONETTE AT THE BRIDGE

The SUPERIMPOSED scene now changes to a view of RONETTE as she was first found walking in a dirty slip on the bridge. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
... Ronette regained conscious and escaped.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
Either he didn’t know or he didn’t care. He made a small mound of dirt and put the half heart necklace of Laura’s on top.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: MOUND OF DIRT

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes back to a view inside the train car where a flashlight spot illuminate a mound of dirt with the gold half heart necklace on top. We continue to PAN the table but now view two pots of coffee.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
He then placed a small cutout letter ‘R’ under the nail of her left ring finger.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: LETTER UNDER FINGERNAIL

The SUPERIMPOSED scene now shows COOPER as he was digging under LAURA’S fingernail with some tweezers in the morge. We continue to SLOWLY PAN the table and view two pots of coffee.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
You’ll recall that he placed the letter ‘T’ under the finger nail of Teresa Banks.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: MOUND OF DIRT

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes back to a view inside the train car where we view a flashlight spot illuminate the mound of dirt with a torn, crumpled piece of paper lying nearby.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
He uh ... left a note written in blood, ‘fire walk with me.’

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Here’s the interesting thing. The blood on the note was tested. It doesn’t match Leo’s, Jacques’s, Laura’s or Ronette’s.

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (0:00 - 1:00)


BACK TO SCENE:

The SUPERIMPOSED scene disappears. We view only a PANNING shot of the table top which now bears a collection of the evidence: LAURA’S photograph, the bloody towel, the twine, LAURA’S diary and copies of FleshWorld.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:15 - 2:09)

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
So, we surmise the killer wrote the note in his own blood. Its a rare type, AB-. The towel that Deputy Hawk found five miles down the tracks was soaked in blood of that type. He also found, near the towel, scraps of faded paper.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
These scraps may have been left by the killer. They’ll be sent back to Washington D.C. for testing.

Holding a photograph of LAURA, ANDY begins to cry.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:15 - 2:09)

ALBERT
(smartass) I know Andy. I know, I know, I know. Its what we call a three hankie crime.

ANDY looks up from the photograph, looks at ALBERT, stands up and points at ALBERT.

ANDY
Albert Rozerfeld, I don’t like the way you talk smart about Sheriff Truman or anybody! You just shut your mouth!

ANDY walks out of the room and SLAMS the door behind himself. LUCY smiles to herself. EVERYONE looks at ALBERT. SHERIFF TRUMAN grins. ALBERT just rolls his eyes.

COOPER
Laura Palmer’s dead. Jacques Renault is dead. Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson are in comas. Waldo the bird is dead. This leaves only the third man.

Oh, this smoke inhalation ... is nasty business. I feel like ... somebody taped my lips to the tailpipe of a bus.

SHERIFF TRUMAN eases PETE into a chair. TRUMAN then pulls up a nearby chair and takes a seat.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So where the hell is Josie?

PETE
Oh, well maybe this will tell us.

PETE opens the envelope, pulls out and unfolds a letter. PETE reads it outloud for SHERIFF TRUMAN.

PETE
Dear Pete. I had to leave the town on an emergency of business to Seattle. I will phone you when I arrive. Hope you did a good day at the mill. There is ginger beer in the refrig. Love Josie.

PETE folds the letter and returns it to its envelope.

PETE
There ya’ go.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Is there a phone number there?

PETE
No.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Does she say where she’s staying?

PETE
No no, she goes off to Seattle once every three months or so. You want my opinion, I think she goes over there to indulge a secret vice.

PETE looks at TRUMAN. Worried, TRUMAN’S eyes widen.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s that?

PETE
Shopping.

PETE chuckles.

PETE
Comes back with half a department store.

PETE laughs, which quickly becomes a slight nagging cough.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Pete, we haven’t found Catherine.

PETE takes a deep breath.

PETE
Yeah. (deep breath) I figured.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know you want to hope for the best but ... you ought to prepare for the worst.

PETE takes another deep breath.

PETE
Oh dear. (teary eyed, sniffling) I always figured I’d be the one to go first. I mean if you was laying odds on the last person standing after an atomic war I’d bet on her.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah, she was a tiger alright.

PETE
Ahh no use mincing words, she was plain hell to live with. Plain hell. But once, there was a little bit of heaven there too.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh I’m sure there was.

PETE
(whispered) Oh god. This will take a little while to sink in I suppose.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I suppose it will.

TRUMAN puts an understanding hand on PETE’S shoulder.

PETE
God help her miserable soul. (in tears) I loved her.

The telephone RINGS. SHERIFF TRUMAN moves to the kitchen, picks up the receiver and answers:

HANK
He’s in a coma. Looks like brain damage.

JERRY
With Leo how could they tell?

BENJAMIN
Why isn’t he dead?

HANK
I caught him center shot with a .44. Couldn’t risk going inside. The neighborhood was hot. I had to sneak past patrols as it was.

BENJAMIN
Anybody see you?

HANK
Negative. He was chopping wood.

JERRY
Chopping wood? Inside?

HANK
Yeah you know Leo.

JERRY gets in HANK’S face.

JERRY
Wait a minute. Chopping wood inside?!

HANK
Yeah you know Leo.

JERRY shakes his head in bewilderment.

BENJAMIN
Alright, what’s next? Catherine. Dead?

HANK
My phone call put her in the drying shed when the place went up. Sounds like buried with the wreckage.

JERRY
Heat like that, they’ll be lucky to find teeth.

HANK

Hank, you leave the creative thinking to the brothers Horne. You’re a bicep. Relax until we say flex.

JERRY reaches out and squeezes HANK’S left arm. HANK immediately reacts by jerking his arm around and shoving JERRY’S arm away. JERRY jerks his arm right back.

JERRY
Now that really makes me mad.

In the dining room seated at the table are DR. HAYWARD, HARRIET HAYWARD, LELAND, SARAH, EILEEN HAYWARD, DONNA and MADELEINE. Standing a short distance from the table and facing the group is GERSTEN HAYWARD, the youngest daughter in the family.

EILEEN
Gersten’s going to tell us about tonight’s proceedings. She has some very good news. We’re all very proud of her.

GERSTEN
Good evening. I’m Gersten Hayward and I would like to welcome you all to the Hayward supper club.

SARAH laughs.

GERSTEN
I’m going to be playing various selections of music for you this evening. My good news is that I was chosen to be the fairy princess in my school play. This is my special dress.

GERSTEN is wearing a tiara, a pink dress and is holding a wand.

GERSTEN
Also I got the highest scores in mathematics and English this midseason term. Just as my sisters Harriet and Donna did before me. (playfully, jokingly) So now I don’t have to worry about being ashamed anymore. Before I play, Harriet would like to read a poem about your daughter and our friend Laura.

HARRIET gets up from her seat and moves to where GERSTEN was standing. GERSTEN has moved to the nearby piano. HARRIET nods to GERSTEN to begin playing. LELAND, with a smile, and SARAH hold hands.

MUSIC: PIANO ???

HARRIET
Uhm. It was Laura and I saw her glowing. In the dark woods I saw her smiling. We were crying and I saw her laughing. In our sadness I saw her dancing. It was Laura living in my dreams. It was Laura. The glow was life. Her smile was to say it was alright to cry. The woods was our sadness. The dance was her calling. It was Laura and she came to kiss me goodbye.

SARAH has tears in her eyes. HARRIET returns to her seat but before she sits she gives LELAND a hug.

LELAND

As EVERYONE eats, LELAND looks at DR. HAYWARD who appears to be quite distant as he quietly sits at the table starring at his plate of food.

LELAND
Long day Will.

DR. HAYWARD wakes up and draws a smile. LELAND chuckles slightly.

DR. HAYWARD
I feel like I’ve sat through back to back operas. In med school we learned to live on three hours a night and cat naps.

LELAND
Its terrible about the mill.

DR. HAYWARD
Yeah. They say more then a hundred and fifty jobs may be lost.

LELAND
Awful just awful.

DR. HAYWARD
I uh suppose this uh will open the door for Ben Horne and his uh big development plans.

LELAND
Well as his lawyer, and yours, of course I can’t comment.

DR. HAYWARD
Well as your doctor Leland, what the hell happened to your hair?

The GROUP laugh slightly.

LELAND
It is strange isn’t it. Well I just uh ... I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror and there it was. It had literally changed overnight.

DR. HAYWARD
Well considering all you’ve been through.

LELAND
You know the funny thing about it is ... seeing it, I realized I had ... turned a corner somehow. I feel a great deal of sadness still, yes, but uh ... it wasn’t as overwhelming to me. I physically felt as if ... a great wave had been lifted from my heart.

DR. HAYWARD
Perhaps it has.

LELAND
(smiling) Perhaps it has, perhaps it has. God I feel like singing.

DR. HAYWARD
(surprised, politely) That would be very nice.

No I really feel like singing a song.

Forget your troubles and just get happy.
You got to pack all your cares away.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
Get ready for the judgment day.
The sun is shining come on get happy.
The lord is waiting to take your hand.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
We’re going to that promised land.
With a hand across the river wash your sins away in the tide.
Its oh so peaceful on the other side.
Forget your troubles come on get happy.
You better chase all your cares away.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Ready for sleep dressed pajamas and under the sheets, AGENT COOPER speaks into his mini tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane its ... 11:55 pm. Approximately nineteen hours since the shooting incident which nearly caused me to make a premature purchase of the proverbial farm. I am dog tired. A man can only go so long without submitting to a period of rest. For as we know from experiments conducted on American GI’s during the Korean war; sleep deprivation is a one way ticket to temporary psychosis. And I’m working on a three day jag. I got so goofy last night Diane, lying here wondering whether I was going to live or die, that I thought I saw a giant in my room. Or perhaps that’s a story that I’ll save for another time. This is me, Dale. Room 315 at the Great Northern Hotel signing off.

AGENT COOPER turns his mini tape recorder off and places it on the bedside table. COOPER turns off the lights, lays back, comforts himself in his sheets and exhales deeply.

I slipped it under your door you must have seen it. I’m up here at One-Eyed Jacks.

BACK TO SCENE:

Dressed in a black nightgown, AUDREY lies on her back on a bed holding her hands together as if praying.

AUDREY
To be perfectly honest I think I’m in a little over my head.

We SLOWLY ZOOM IN on AUDREY’S face. AUDREY fiddles with a small white pillow.

AUDREY
Not that I can’t handle it. I mean I’m going to help you out with your investigations. I’m sure I’ll be put into situations a lot more dangerous then this on a fairly regular basis. But its just ... you know, my first time out. I could use a little expert guidance. Just so you know, there is a connection between Horne’s Department Store and One-Eyed Jacks. Its my father, he owns the place. But a bald old sleaze named Battis helps to recruit some of the girls from the perfume counter. Tomorrow I’m going to try to find out if Laura and Ronette came up here. I hope you won’t think any less of me for trying to help you. You know I promised I’d only did it with the best of intentions. Then if there’s any way ... if there’s any way in the world that you can hear my right now. Please help me.

With tears in her eyes AUDREY clutches the pillow and with a slight cry in her voice, whispers:

AUDREY
Help me.

GIANT
Sorry to wake you.

COOPER raises his head from the pillow.

COOPER
I am not dreaming.

GIANT
I forgot to tell you something.

COOPER
You were right about the smiling bag.

GIANT
The things I tell you will not be wrong.

COOPER opens his mouth to say something but the GIANT raises his left hand to stop him from speaking.

GIANT
Better to listen than to talk.

COOPER
I believe you.

GIANT
Don’t search for all the answers at once. A path is formed by laying one stone at a time.

COOPER nod his head for yes.

GIANT
One person saw the third man. Three have seen him, yes, but not his body. One only known to you. Ready now to talk. One more thing. You forgot something.

COOPER
What?

The GIANT raises his left hand. A bright light fills the room. A ball of light forms near the GIANT and flies toward COOPER.

As above, so below. The human being finds himself, or herself, in the middle. There is as much space outside the human, proportionately, as inside. Stars, moons and planets remind us of protons, neutrons and electrons. Is there a bigger being walking with all the stars within? Does our thinking affect what goes on outside us and what goes on inside us? I think it does. Where does creamed corn figure into the workings of the universe? What really is creamed corn?

SONG: BARBER SHOP QUARTET

In the dining area of the Great Northern Hotel, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER and AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD are having breakfast. In the background is a barber shop quartet singing. The dining area is rather busy.

COOPER
Buddhist tradition first came to the land of snow in the fifth century AD. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the Dharma was King Hathatha Rignamputsan. He and succeeding kings were collectively known as the Happy Generations. Now some historians place them in the Water Snake Year, 213 AD. Others in the year of the water ox 173 AD. Amazing isn’t it? The Happy Generations.

COOPER eats his breakfast.

ALBERT
Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces that the Dharma came to King Ho-Ho-Ho, I really am, but right now I’m trying hard to focus on the more immediate problems of our own century right here in Twin Peaks.

COOPER
Albert, you’d be surprised at the connection between the two.

ALBERT
(sarcastic) Color me amazed.

COOPER
Ronette Pulaski has woken from her coma.

ALBERT
And?

COOPER
I’m thinking she’s gonna have quite a story to tell when she regains the ability to speak.

ALBERT
So she’s not talking?

COOPER
Waking but silence, probably shock. I’m going to show her the sketches of Leo Johnson and Bob, the man Sarah Palmer saw in her vision. The man who came to me in my dream.

ALBERT
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth in the last few weeks?

COOPER
No, not yet.

ALBERT grabs a nearby folder on the table and opens it.

ALBERT
Okay, I uh performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault. Stomach contents revealed ... lets see: beer cans, a Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat and a small wooden puppet, goes by the name of Pinocchio.

ALBERT puts the folder aside. COOPER turn to him, smiles and says ...

COOPER
You’re making a joke.

ALBERT
I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.

ALBERT smirks.

ALBERT
And by the way, the fat boy wasn’t strangled. Killer snuffed him with a pillow, he was wearing gloves. Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen from the hospital supply closet and that is it. If Jacques has any secrets he’ll be taking them underground.

COOPER
What about the mill?

ALBERT
Well, preliminary suggests arson. I nominate Leo Johnson.

COOPER
We’ll have to get a statement from Shelly Johnson.

ALBERT
Hospital says she’s well enough.

ALBERT looks at COOPER.

ALBERT
How do you feel?

COOPER
Me?

ALBERT
I believe it’s customary to ask after the health of one recently plugged three times.

COOPER
Thanks for asking.

ALBERT turns away.

ALBERT
Don’t get sentimental.

COOPER
Who shot me, Albert?

ALBERT looks around the room.

ALBERT
My men are interrogating the hotel guests, the usual bumper crop of rural know-nothings and drunken fly-fishermen. Nothing so far. Oh, the world’s most decrepit room service waiter remembers nothing out of the ordinary about the night in question, no surprise there. Señor Droolcup has, shall we say, a mind that wanders?

COOPER raises his right hand.

COOPER
Albert, my ring is gone. One day here ... the next day gone.

ALBERT
So?

COOPER
I’m glad you’re with us Albert. We need the very best.

ALBERT
Dedication to duty wasn’t the only thing that brought me back here Cooper.

COOPER
What else?

ALBERT
Windom Earle.

COOPER looks at ALBERT.

GRANDSON
Miss.

Spooked, DONNA turns her head to see a young boy sitting in a chair, wearing a tuxedo.

DONNA
Oh, hi.

SHERIFF TRUMAN spins the top of the seat to try to screw it down. COOPER looks for a lever to push or pull to lower the seat.

COOPER
I can’t get this thing to work.

COOPER continues to look for a way to lower the seat. COOPER looks over to RONETTE.

COOPER
Excuse us, Ronette.

TRUMAN bends down and finds preliminary instructions on the stool support. TRUMAN reads the instructions outloud for COOPER, who is having a hard time bending down due to his injuries.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Stop. Read operating instructions beneath seat before using.

TRUMAN looks under the seat. COOPER listens on. TRUMAN finds the instructions and reads them outloud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Stand next to chair or stool. Do not remain seated. Place foot on base and pull seat all the way up until you hear a click.

COOPER follows the directions as TRUMAN reads them. As COOPER pulls the seat all the way up he slightly strains himself and lets out a slight GRUNT. COOPER looks at RONETTE.

Sorry Ronette.

COOPER and TRUMAN successfully lower the seats on their stools. COOPER and TRUMAN sit down. COOPER leans to RONETTE.

COOPER
Okay, I’m glad you’re feeling better. I don’t want to upset you but we need your help. I’m going to show you some sketches. We need to know if you’ve seen these men before. We need to know if these are the men that hurt you, okay.

JERRY
Brother Ben, we’ve got two ledgers and one smoked cheese pig. Which one do we burn?

We FOCUS on a WIDE-SHOT of the office, BENJAMIN HORNE, holding a cigar, sits next to JERRY on the floor. Behind BEN and JERRY is a small fire in the fireplace. JERRY turns to BEN.

JERRY
And it ain’t gonna be my pig.

JERRY starts to naw on his cheese pig. BEN taps his index finger on the green ledger closest to him.

BENJAMIN
The real ledger shows the mill slowly seeking into bankruptcy, masterminded by Catherine. The one she faked, for public consumption, shows the mill turning a healthy profit.

JERRY
So which one do we burn?

JERRY returns to chewing on his cheese pig.

BENJAMIN
Catherine’s dead. We put all of our money on Josie. Catherine takes the fall for the fire. Josie profits the insurance money, sells us the mill and the land and ... nah, wait a minute.

BEN snaps his fingers.

BENJAMIN
First she has to get dear Pete to sign on the dotted line.

JERRY
Why does Pete have to sign?

BENJAMIN
Andrew’s will calls for Catherine or her heirs to approve of any sale.

JERRY
So which one do we burn?

JERRY returns to eating his cheese pig.

BENJAMIN
Once Josie sells us the mill we could get a better price if it appears to be more profitable.

JERRY
So we burn the real one.

BENJAMIN
On the other hand, the real one would hold up under any future scrutiny.

JERRY
Depending upon on how one looks at the situation it appears ... they both have merit.

BENJAMIN
I know.

BEN looks at JERRY.

BENJAMIN
Maybe we should burn both of them.

Smiling, JERRY looks at BEN.

JERRY
(amused tone) It looks like we are one hundred percent certain that we’re not sure.

BENJAMIN
Jer, obviously something requires burning ... and since we don’t want to set fire to your smoked ... cheese ... pig.

BEN stands up, pats his brother on the back and moves to his desk.

BENJAMIN
Why don’t we uh ...

BEN opens a drawer of his desk.

CUT TO:

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is sitting on the floor beside the front door of the diner. ANDY fumbles with some scotch tape that he has managed to get tangled and pieced all around his hands and fingers. ANDY struggles to remove the tape but can’t. A piece of scotch tape has even managed to wind up on his head. One of the sheriff’s "Have you seen this man" wanted posters with the sketch of BOB is tapped on the door.

MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS sits with a mug of coffee at the island counter. Hearing all the tape ruffling, MAJOR BRIGGS turns around to look at ANDY.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he struggle to remove the scotch tape from his fingers and hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS turns around once more and briefly looks at ANDY. MAJOR BRIGGS returns back to his coffee and takes a sip.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he struggles to remove the scotch tape from his fingers and hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS turns around again and look at ANDY, trying to see exactly what is going on.

Having not improved his situation at all, we FOCUS on ANDY as he struggle to remove the scotch tape. ANDY is interrupted as someone walks up to the door. ANDY moves aside slightly and stares at the person as they enter the building.

MAJOR BRIGGS stares at his coffee mug. The person that entered the diner is the LOG LADY, carrying her log and chewing pitch gum, and she takes a seat to the left of MAJOR BRIGGS. NORMA JENNINGS, standing behind the island counter, walks up to the LOG LADY with a coffee mug and a pot of coffee.

NORMA
Margaret, it’s always very nice to see you.

NORMA pours the LOG LADY a cup of coffee.

NORMA
But if you’re going to spit your sticky pitch gum out in the diner, would you please use an ash tray and not the counter or the booth like you did last time.

The LOG LADY stops chewing and stares at NORMA. The LOG LADY swallows her gum.

LOG LADY
I’ll have a bear claw.

NORMA walks off. The LOG LADY turns to MAJOR BRIGGS and looks him over.

LOG LADY
You wear shiny objects on your chest.

MAJOR BRIGGS looks down at his chest.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes I do.

LOG LADY
Are you proud?

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.

For the LOG LADY’S coffee, MAJOR BRIGGS points to a canister of ...

MAJOR BRIGGS
Cream?

The LOG LADY shies away, places a hand over her coffee mug and slides it close to herself. MAJOR BRIGGS takes a sip from his coffee mug. The LOG LADY places her hand back on her log and turns to MAJOR BRIGGS.

LOG LADY
My log has something to tell you. Do you know it?

MAJOR BRIGGS
(puzzled) I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.

LOG LADY
(scornfully) I do not introduce the Log. Can you hear it?

MAJOR BRIGGS looks at the log.

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, ma’am. I cannot.

LOG LADY
I will translate.

The LOG LADY turns to her log.

LOG LADY
Deliver the message.

The LOG LADY looks at MAJOR BRIGGS.

LOG LADY
Do you understand?

MAJOR BRIGGS nods his head.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes, ma’am. As a matter of fact I do.

MAJOR BRIGGS ponders over the message. MAJOR BRIGGS peers over to the LOG LADY, who now quietly chews on some pitch gum. MAJOR BRIGGS thinks it over some more then peers over to the LOG LADY again.

CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAK SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

LUCY works at her desk in the reception office. A fly buzzes around and distracts her attention. LUCY’S eyes track the fly as it buzzes around her office.

Just outside the front double doors of the building, ANDY paces back and forth.

Sitting still, LUCY watches the fly land. LUCY slowly gets up to try and kill it but it starts to buzz around her office again. LUCY sits back down and tracks it.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he continues to pace just outside the front double doors of the building.

LUCY tracks the fly as it buzzes around her office. Holding a pencil in her hand LUCY watches the fly land and flings the pencil at, killing it.

ANDY enters the building and walks up to the reception office window. ANDY still has a piece of scotch tape in his hair. At the window, ANDY sees LUCY bent over as she looks for her pencil. ANDY nervously looks away. LUCY sits back up and immediately notices the scotch tape in ANDY’S hair. ANDY slides open the plexiglass window to LUCY’S office.

LUCY
(coldly and formally) No messages, Deputy Brennan.

LUCY closes the window. ANDY opens it again.

ANDY
Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen. The Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors, naturally I applied. It’s my civic duty and I like whales. A routine physical examination revealed that I’m sterile. Sure, I thought it meant I didn’t have to take a bath but the doctors told me the truth. They told me I can’t have babies. So what I want to know now is why you’re having one and how?

LUCY stares at ANDY, then she stands up and slowly leans forward to him. ANDY assumes a kiss, so he leans forward, closes his eyes and puckers his lips. But LUCY quickly reaches out with her right hand and pulls the scotch tape from ANDY’S hair. LUCY quickly closes the window and takes a seat. Confused and disappointed, ANDY walks off. LUCY now struggles to remove the scotch tape from her hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hello, Hank. I bet Lucy asked you to wait outside.

HANK
(uncaring) Hmm ... might of.

HANK gestures to deer head trophy.

HANK
You know that’s an awfully cute buck, Harry.

HANK laughs. SHERIFF TRUMAN goes through some of his files on his desk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Let’s not waste our time.

HANK
Okay.

TRUMAN opens a folder, checks it over and then tosses it on his desk next to HANK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why don’t you ... just sign in like a good boy? Keep your nose clean for another week.

HANK sternly looks at TRUMAN. HANK looks at COOPER and then grabs a pen. HANK smiles and chuckles slightly as he signs with an ‘H’ and a period. HANK closes the folder and chuckles again. Before he exits HANK turns to COOPER.

HANK
It’s really nice to see you again.

Straight faced, COOPER looks at HANK. HANK exits and shuts the door behind himself. SHERIFF TRUMAN grabs the folder and looks it over.

COOPER
Interesting piece of work.

TRUMAN closes the folder.

COOPER
How long were you and Hank friends?

TRUMAN throws the folder to his desktop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We grew up together. Hank used to be a Bookhouse Boy. Back then, Hank was one of the best of us.

The intercom BUZZES. TRUMAN looks down at the intercom unit on his desk. LUCY’S voice eminates from the intercom speaker.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

Wearing sunglasses, JERRY enters the open double doors of the office flapping a sheet of paper in his hand like a flying bird. JERRY walks up to the desk and checks the document one last time. BENJAMIN sits behind the desk with a glass of wine in his right hand.

JERRY
One insurance policy, unsigned.

BENJAMIN
Un?

JERRY tosses the document onto BEN’S desk.

JERRY
The agent said that Catherine was concerned about certain irregularities, such as Josie being named chief beneficiary.

BEN looks at the document.

BENJAMIN
Agent wasn’t supposed to show it to her.

JERRY
Well, considering Catherine’s ... smoky fate, for our side ... it’s all for the best.

BENJAMIN
Well, win a few lose a few. Let’s get those pickled icemen on the blower.

JERRY walks around the desk to the phone and dials a number. LELAND PALMER marches confidently through the open double doors of the office and walks up to BEN’S desk.

LELAND
Gentlemen, I’ve been giving this a lot of thought. This mill fire will no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment. So we must ensure that the moment, our moment, does not pass us by.

On the phone, JERRY gestures to LELAND to keep it down.

LELAND
I therefore recommend that we make a quick but cordial follow up phone call to Iceland. Do a little gentle handling. Let Einar know that we’re right on top of this thing.

JERRY hands the phone to BEN and somewhat scornfully tells LELAND ...

JERRY
We can handle that.

BEN scornfully looks at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
Ben Horne for Einar Thornson.

LELAND
(surprised; elated) Oh, now this is a coincidence.

JERRY leans down towards the phone and tries to listen to the conversation.

BENJAMIN
Blis blis Einar! (reply) What’s that?

BEN gestures to JERRY to move closer and listen.

BENJAMIN
Where did you hear about it?

BEN and JERRY scornfully look at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
Mr. Palmer called to tell you about the fire?

Smiling, LELAND nods his head for yes and points to himself. JERRY shakes his head in disappointment at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
No, no I wouldn’t call it a disaster at all. It’s just uh just one on those things, an unfortunate development. But I assure you, Einar, that in no way will it affect our development plans.

JERRY grabs the phone from BEN. BEN scornfully looks at LELAND. LELAND nods an understanding of his actions.

JERRY
Jerry Horne here Einar, kor die blesser. Full speed ahead! Eh, eh.

BENJAMIN grabs the phone from JERRY.

BENJAMIN
Yes, yes of course Einar. We will fax all pertinent details to you. (reply) Yes, yes I promise.

LELAND nods his head to show his agreement.

LELAND walks out of the office with the flyer. BEN and JERRY, hunched over the desk beside each other, stare into the office where LELAND was standing.

DR. HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in Leo’s spine ...

DR. HAYWARD notices SHELLY standing a distance away from LEO. DR. HAYWARD persuades SHELLY to come closer.

DR. HAYWARD
It’s alright Shelly, come on.

SHELLY moves besides the foot of the bed. DR. HAYWARD stands at the head of the bed. Between DR. HAYWARD and SHELLY is a mirror that reflects the image of LEO’S face.

DR. HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in his spine but we removed it successfully. As for possible paralysis it’s too early to tell. Leo lost a lot of blood, most of it before we had a chance to operate. I fear the resulting oxygen deprivation starved his brain, induced the coma you see here.

SHELLY
Is he a vegetable?

SHELLY looks at DR. HAYWARD.

SHELLY
Is he in pain?

DR. HAYWARD
He’s not in pain. Beyond that it’s hard to say.

SHELLY looks back at LEO.

SHELLY
Can you make him better?

DR. HAYWARD
We can maintain his current state: offer nutrition, life-support. Beyond that the only ally we have is time. I’m sorry Shelly.

SHELLY
Me too.

SHELLY looks at DR. HAYWARD.

SHELLY
Are they going to put him in prison?

DR. HAYWARD
I know he’s a suspect in several felonies.

SHELLY looks back at LEO.

SHELLY
I guess at the moment he’s kind of in prison anyway.

DR. HAYWARD
Yes he is.

SHELLY becomes upset and begins to cry. DR. HAYWARD moves over to comfort her.

DR. HAYWARD
Come on, I’ll take you back to your room. Norma’s waiting downstairs to drive you home.

DR. HAYWARD escorts SHELLY out. We ZOOM IN on the mirror reflecting the image of LEO’S face.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PAINTED TOES

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a foot that is also tied and rests on the back of a chair. On the foot, the toes are kept apart by cotton balls and each toe nail has been painted with red nail polish. We PAN LEFT and to FOCUS on the other foot which is in the same situation.


BACK TO SCENE:

One of the establishments 52’ PICK-UP’S, a hospitality girl, walks up a corridor carrying an ice bucket. A vacuum cleaner can still be heard RUNNING. AUDREY HORNE, wearing a long black night gown, steps out into the hall, stops the 52’ PICK-UP and reaches out for the ice bucket.

AUDREY
Hey I’ll take it from here.

52’ PICK-UP
(smiling) No, no you won’t.

AUDREY
No, it’s okay.

The 52’ PICK-UP thinks it over and then relents. She hands AUDREY the ice bucket.

52’ PICK-UP
Okay, but watch out for this one.

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY walks up the corridor to an open door. AUDREY enters the room and, with her hands full, shuts the door with her foot. EMORY BATTIS, the store vice-president of Horne’s Department Store, is blindfolded and wearing a robe. EMORY is lying on his back on a daybed with his hands tied together with rope that is tied to the ceiling. With his head resting at the foot of the bed, EMORY’S feet are tied and rest at the head of the bed. To the left of the bed, another 52’ PICK-UP, with long red hair and wearing a western themed outfit, pushes a vacuum cleaner that has very squeaky wheels.

Still carrying the ice bucket, AUDREY walks beside the daybed and gestures with a nod to the 52’ PICK-UP to leave. The 52’ PICK-UP shakes her head for no and continues to push the vacuum. AUDREY again nods and 52’ PICK-UP shakes her head for no again. AUDREY puts the ice bucket down on a chair that lies against the back wall of the room. AUDREY turns back to the 52’ PICK-UP and points to the door for her to leave. The 52’ PICK-UP starts to say something to AUDREY but relents. The 52’ PICK-UP lets go of the vacuum cleaner but leaves it on, presents the vacuum to AUDREY and then walks out.

AUDREY walks around the room and looks down at EMORY. AUDREY pulls the vacuum’s electrical cord out of the wall socket and the vacuum cleaner come to a quiet stop.

EMORY
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?!

AUDREY walks around EMORY, bends down and whispers in his ear ...

AUDREY
Look at those toes.

EMORY, unable to see her, turns his head towards AUDREY’S voice.

EMORY
What toes?

AUDREY stands back up.

AUDREY
I brought the ice.

EMORY
(relaxed and excited) Frosty, my little snowman. I feel the cold front moving in.

AUDREY, still holding the electrical cord from the vacuum cleaner, kneels down and wraps the cord around EMORY’S neck.

AUDREY
Mmmm.

AUDREY pulls off EMORY’S blindfold and pulls the electrical cord taut around his neck. EMORY struggles to breathe.

AUDREY
Hi ya, Emory! Do you remember me, huh?

AUDREY looks at EMORY’S tied hands and feet.

AUDREY
It really looks like you got yourself in a fix here, huh. Well guess what? I’m going to tell you a nice little bedtime story. Are you ready?

AUDREY
Did Laura come here?

EMORY
One weekend. She was using drugs. We threw her out. I never saw her again I swear.

AUDREY

AUDREY tugs on the cord.

AUDREY

EMORY

SHELLY
I don’t care about the money. I don’t want Leo home.

BOBBY
Leo is in dream land.

SHELLY looks away.

BOBBY
You can sit him in a corner and hang donuts from his ears.

SHELLY
Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.

BOBBY
No way. Look, they can’t force you to testify against your husband. All you’ve got to do is get Leo home, sit and collect the checks.

BOBBY gently grasps SHELLY’S chin and turns her head toward his.

BOBBY
Leo owes you baby. Now we can really make him pay. You want something nice? We can buy it. You want to go some place special, sit in the sun? It’s on Leo. Understand?

SHELLY looks away and thinks it over.

SHELLY
I guess it would be nice not to have to worry about money.

SHELLY looks back at BOBBY.

SHELLY

BACK TO SCENE:

Dressed in his pajamas, AGENT COOPER sits on the edge of his bed. COOPER holds his mini tape recorder in his right hand as he speaks.

COOPER
Diane, I received some very bad news today. Windom Earle has vanished. The disappearance of my former partner is extremely troubling. I also learned that Audrey Horne is missing. Audrey’s absence touches me in ways I could not predict. I find myself thinking not of clues or of evidence but of the content of her smile.

There is a KNOCK at the door. COOPER presses the stop button on his mini recorder.

COOPER
(called out) Who is it?

MAJOR BRIGGS
It’s Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.

COOPER
(called out) Just a moment.

COOPER puts his mini recorder on the bed and slowly stands up. COOPER makes his way over to the door, unlocks it and opens it.

COOPER
Major.

MAJOR BRIGGS
May I come in?

COOPER
Please.

MAJOR BRIGGS walks inside and COOPER shuts the door. MAJOR BRIGGS is dressed in his usual Air Force uniform. MAJOR BRIGGS holds his hat in his right hand with his jacket draped over his right arm. In his left hand, MAJOR BRIGGS carries a briefcase. COOPER walks over to MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have a message for you.

COOPER
From whom?

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to corruption. But these rules I have pledged to uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.

COOPER
Speaking as a man and a fellow employee of the Federal Government, so do I.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well, I may reveal this much: among my many tasks is the maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies beyond our own.

MAJOR BRIGGS places his hat and jacket on a nearby chair and lays his briefcase on the seat. MAJOR BRIGGS opens the briefcase.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We routinely receive various communications, space garbage, to decode and examine.

MAJOR BRIGGS takes a computer printout sheet out of his briefcase and holds it up in front of COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS
They look something like this ... radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper.

MAJOR BRIGGS looks down at the file and then back to COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Till Thursday night, Friday morning to be exact.

COOPER
Around the time I was shot.

MAJOR BRIGGS

MAJOR BRIGGS runs his finger over the lines of random numbers and letters.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Row after row of gibberish and all of a sudden ...

MAJOR BRIGGS points to one line on the page and runs his finger over it as he reads it outloud.

MAJOR BRIGGS
The owls are not what they seem.

COOPER leans toward the printout to see for himself.


COOPER’S POV:

Through COOPER’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the line of text that MAJOR BRIGGS points out. Amongst the random numbers and letters, one line reads:

Amazed, COOPER looks up at MAJOR BRIGGS.

COOPER
Why did you bring this to me?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Because later in the morning ...

MAJOR BRIGGS flips the sheet over and points to one line amongst the gibberish of random numbers and letters. MAJOR BRIGGS runs his finger over the words as he reads them outloud.

MAJOR BRIGGS

CUT TO:

INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

In the living room holding a guitar, JAMES HURLEY, sits in a chair while DONNA and MADELEINE FERGUSON sit together on the floor beside a microphone.

JAMES
That was really good. Let’s try it again.

SONG: JUST YOU AND I   371K

JAMES plays a tune on the guitar. DONNA stares longing up at JAMES. MADELEINE looks at DONNA and then to JAMES. JAMES plays the guitar and sings into a microphone as DONNA and MADELEINE sing the back vocals (in italics) into their microphone. The song is amplified over a speaker as they sing.

JAMES, DONNA & MADELEINE
Just you and I.
Just you and I.
Together.
Forever.
In love.
Just you Just you.
And I And I.
Just you Just you.
And I And I.
Together.
Forever.
In love.
In love In love.
We go strolling together In love.
In love In love.

JAMES and DONNA stare at each other.

JAMES, DONNA & MADELEINE
We go strolling forever.
Oh.
Just you and I.
Just you and I.
Together.
Forever.
In love.
Just you.

MADELEINE seductively looks at JAMES. JAMES looks at MADELEINE.

DONNA & MADELEINE
And I.
Just you.
And I.
Just you.
And I.

DONNA notices that JAMES is starring at MADELEINE. DONNA turns to MADELEINE to see that she is starring at JAMES. DONNA becomes upset.

JAMES, DONNA & MADELEINE
Just you.
And I.
Just y...

DONNA stops singing and jealously runs off.

SONG ENDS: JUST YOU AND I   371K

MADELEINE watches DONNA run off. JAMES stops playing the guitar, puts it down and run after DONNA.

JAMES
Donna!

JAMES finds DONNA facing a wall in a small space near the staircase.

JAMES
Donna, what’s wrong?

DONNA
Nothing.

DONNA turns around, throws her arms around JAMES and kisses him.

JAMES
Donna?

The telephone RINGS.

JAMES
Donna, what’s going on?

DONNA kisses JAMES again.

DONNA
I’m trembling James. You made me.

Still holding him, DONNA repeatedly kisses JAMES.

JAMES
Donna?

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she sits alone on the floor in the living room. Slightly ashamed, MADELEINE folds her arms.

The telephone is answered by DR. HAYWARD upstairs.

DR. HAYWARD
Donna!

DONNA
Yes!

DR. HAYWARD
There’s a telephone call for you from a Harold Smith!

DONNA
Oh, okay! I’ll get it in the hallway!

DONNA removes her arms from JAMES and walks off down the hallway. DONNA picks up the phone and yells back upstairs.

DONNA
Okay, dad. I got it!

DR. HAYWARD
Okay, sweetheart!

DONNA speaks on the phone.

DONNA
Hello, Mr. Smith. (reply) I received yours. (reply) I wanted to talk to you.

JAMES walks into the hall and stares at DONNA as she talks on the phone.

DONNA
We can meet? (reply) Okay.

JAMES and DONNA stare at each other. The other line on the phone hangs up.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she sits alone on the floor in the living room. MADELEINE turns her head and looks into the dining room. A vision unravels before her ...


MADELEINE’S POV:

MUSIC: WALKING IN THE DARK   32K

From MADELEINE’S POV we view the living room with dining room in the background. In the distant background a MAN walks into the dining room from the right. The MAN slowly walks forward, wearing a jean jacket and having long gray dirty hair, the MAN is BOB.


BACK TO SCENE:

Frozen, MADELEINE sits on the floor as her face reveals an alarm but she looks on.


MADELEINE’S POV:

BOB enters the living room and slowly climbs over the couch. BOB wears a frighteningly evil grin as he slithers over the coffee table.


BACK TO SCENE:

Shocked, MADELEINE, still sitting on the floor, looks on.


MADELEINE’S POV:

BOB is very close. BOB’S eyes pierce like a madman and his grin sends shivers of terror. BOB comes closer and closer until his frightening image fills the screen.


BACK TO SCENE:

MADELEINE throws her hands to her mouth and screams. JAMES and DONNA quickly rush to MADELEINE’S side. MADELEINE has become quite upset and shakes in fear. JAMES and DONNA offer reassuring hands of support and comfort MADELEINE as best they can. MADELEINE looks back into the dining room. JAMES and DONNA follow her gaze.


MADELEINE’S POV:

Through MADELEINE’S POV, the dining room and the living room are empty. BOB is nowhere to be seen.


BACK TO SCENE:

MADELEINE starts to calm down but is still visibly shaken.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

In the dark, AGENT COOPER sleeps with an arm draped over his eyes. The GIANT waves his hand through the air above COOPER to see if he notices and is awake. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.

We view images from COOPER’S dream.


CLOSE ON: RONETTE

In slow motion and in the dark, RONETTE jumps and squirms around in her bed, at Calhoun Memorial Hospital, as if going into convulsions. We are witnessing an event that happened earlier in the day when RONETTE reacted in fear after viewing the sketch of BOB. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.


CLOSE ON: BOB

We view a blurred form of what appears to be BOB walking in the dark. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.

GIANT (OFF SCREEN)

CLOSE ON: GIANT

We view an image of the GIANT standing as he did when he spoke to COOPER the night before. The GIANT is so tall his head nearly touches the ceiling and is next to the ceiling light fixture. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.


CLOSE ON: BOB

We view another past event, one of SARAH PALMER’S visions. We view an image of BOB, with his long grayish hair and jean jacket, crouched behind a bedpost in LAURA PALMER’S bedroom. BOB is starring right up at us. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.

Slowly, the image of an owl is superimposed over BOB’S frightening face.


CLOSE ON: SARAH PALMER

We view another past event. In slow motion, SARAH PALMER runs down the staircase in her home. A ceiling fan, hanging over the stairs, circulates. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING.

SARAH
Llaauurrrraaaa! Llaauurrrraaaa!


CLOSE ON: BOB

We return to the blurred image of what appears to be BOB walking toward us in the dark. There is the sound of a ceiling fan CIRCULATING. Slowly, the image of BOB comes into focus. BOB wears a frighteningly evil grin and terror inducing eyes.


BACK TO SCENE:

The phone RINGS and AGENT COOPER, with an arm draped over his eyes, wakes up. Without getting up, COOPER reaches for the phone on the bedside table and answers it.

COOPER

We continue to PAN DOWN until we FOCUS on the telephone cradle.

AUDREY
I am in trouble but I’m gonna come home now ...

A hand reaches out and presses the phone cradle, hanging up the phone. AUDREY’S telephone connection terminates. Scared, AUDREY quickly turns around to see what happened.

2. INT. RONETTE PULASKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN is turning off the alarm on the INTRAVENOUS feeding monitor, the pole holding the intravenous bag is lying on the floor, the bag still connected to it. A screaming RONETTE is being restrained by two NURSES, as DALE COOPER and ALBERT ROSENFIELD arrive in the doorway.

TRUMAN
Ronette got out of bed a while ago, pulled out her IV -

Cooper moves to her. Albert examines the IV bag. The contents are tinted blue.

ALBERT
Looks like dye.

Cooper takes out a pair of tweezers.

COOPER
Hold her down, Harry. Albert, get your microscope.

Albert opens his case, takes out a FIELD MICROSCOPE. Cooper takes out a pair of tweezers, lifts Ronette's left hand. Her ring finger is bruised and bloodied under the nail.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
(firmly)
Hold on, Ronette. Hold on.

Cooper goes in with the tweezers. She screams.

3. ALBERT'S MICROSCOPE: A SMALL LETTER

A piece of paper with the letter "B" on it.

COOPER
He's been here.

TRUMAN
We had a 24 hour guard.

COOPER
Nevertheless, he did this and he tried to taint her IV.

TRUMAN
Maybe her screams scared him away.

ALBERT
Maybe she heard a Sousa March and was looking for her
baton. I'll do a work-up on the IV.

COOPER
It was our man. The letters were never made public.
(turns to face them)
Fellas ... let's stand together for a moment ... it's time I
mentioned something to you I'm not sure ...
but I believe I was visited by a Giant.
(they look at him)
In my room. Twice. He gave me three clues; the first
had to do with Jacques in his body bag and came true
almost immediately. The second was "the owls are not
what they seem," and the third was about a man who
points without chemicals.

They look at him.

ALBERT
Any relation to the dwarf?

TRUMAN
(still processing)
You were visited by a giant?

4. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 4.

DONNA HAYWARD stands nervously outside the door. From inside we can hear a piano concerto. Chopin. Before Donna can knock, HAROLD SMITH opens the door. He is handsome, late 20's, dressed comfortably. Smith seems to be inspecting her in a gentle, caressing way.

SMITH
You're wearing a different dress than yesterday. A better
color for you.
(extending, a hand)
I've forgotten my manners. I'm Harold Smith.

DONNA
I guess you know who I am.

Smith nods, swings the door open wider. Donna walks into his apartment.
CUT TO:


5. INT. SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

The front room of Smith's apartment. Neurotically neat, but comfortable. An interior window looks in on an inner room, obscured by curtains.

SMITH
Please, sit down. Would you like some lemonade? I
also have a little apple butter and some saltines.

DONNA
No thanks.

Smith sits. She sits across from him.

SMITH
Don't be nervous, Donna.

DONNA
I'm not nervous. I'm curious.

SMITH
Curious about my relationship with Laura.

DONNA
Why did you send me that letter?

SMITH
Laura wanted me to get in touch with you if anything
ever happened to her.

DONNA
Why?

SMITH
She said you would ask a lot of questions.

A Chesire cat smile. Donna decides to slow down.

DONNA
You don't seem much like a shut in.

SMITH
You mean, politely, what's the matter with me?

DONNA
Okay.

SMITH
I don't like to go outside. I ... can't. Do you have a
judgement about that you'd like to express?

DONNA
No.

Donna notices a piece of paper sticking out from under what appears to be the solid edge of a bookshelf

SMITH
Laura said you were very fair-minded.

DONNA
If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you
to me?

SMITH
She liked to think of me ... as a mystery in her life.

DONNA
Then why did you call me?

SMITH
I am ... I used to be a horticulturist. I raise orchids.
That's why it's so warm. in here. Laura always admired
them. I wrote you because I wanted to know if you'd be
kind enough to place one of them on her grave.

DONNA
Of course.

SMITH
Excuse me just a moment.

He goes into an adjoining room. The door is heavy, with a substantial lock. Donna rises quickly, goes to the bookshelf, tugs on the piece of paper. It won't budge. She notices a gap between the shelf and the wall, moves closer to take a look, then turns abruptly as the heavy door opens behind her and Smith re-enters, carrying, a beautiful orchid plant. He conceals any concern about her movements.

SMITH
This is a hybrid; a lady-slipper.

DONNA
It's beautiful.

SMITH
Take it, please.
(she does)
My last gift to Laura.

DONNA
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.

SMITH
Harold. Laura was very kind to me.

DONNA
Why don't you like to go outside?

SMITH
(pause, vulnerable)
If I knew the answer to that ...
(looks at her, a sweet, aching look of longing;
then has to look away)
Forgive me ...

DONNA
What?

SMITH
You're every bit as lovely as Laura said you were

DONNA
(intrigued, likes him)
I'll be back.

SMITH
I'll be here.

He smiles. She smiles, exits.

7. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Cooper is taping the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN on to the blackboard. Below the poster he writes the letters B, R, and T. Truman and Rosenfield watch.

COOPER
R-B-T: I believe these letters and the giant's clues are in
some way connected to the long haired man.
(writes the names in a circle around the poster.)
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision. She called this
morning to say Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson, has seen
the man twice in the last three days, also in a vision. I
saw him in my dream.

TRUMAN
And Ronnette -

COOPER
- saw him physically in the train car. Four of us have
seen this man in different forms.
(draws a line from one name to another)
The path is a psychic link that will lead us to this man.

TRUMAN
So what did the giant sound like? Kind of a big
booming voice?

COOPER
No. He spoke very softly, directly and distinctly.

ALBERT
And you gave him the beans you were supposed to use to
buy a cow.

COOPER
(grins holds up his hand)
No, I gave him my ring.

Albert deadpans, opens his briefcase on the table and goes to work.

ALBERT
Confining my conclusions to the planet Earth ...

Albert takes out THREE SMALL PACKETS OF COCAINE.

ALBERT
The cocaine you found in James Hurley's gas tank is a
match to what we found in Jacques' car and at Leo
Johnson's house. Get the picture?

COOPER
I've even got the frame.

ALBERT
The handywork of Leo Johnson, currently appearing at
Calhoun Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.
(retrieves a FLESHWORLD from his case)
The boots are a CircleBrand rare work boot. The ones
we found haven't been worn or tampered with. The
letter "B" from Ronette's finger was cut from a copy of
Fleshworld. A perfect match. This edition features a
swingers club for double amputees. No comment.

Albert points to the poster of the long-haired man.

ALBERT
We sent the portrait of our long haired man to every
agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty. This
cat is in nobody's data base.

COOPER
A man four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks.

ALBERT
(takes out three crushed bullets)
By the way, you were shot with a Walther PPK. James
Bond's gun.
(he smiles, starts to load up his case)
The trail of who shot you is cold, Coop, but I hoovered
some fibers from the corridor outside your room. My
ticket out of Trolleyville. I'm headed back to the lab.

Albert snaps his briefcase closed.

TRUMAN
Anything we should be working on?

ALBERT
Practice walking without dragging your knuckles on the
floor.

He moves to leave, but Truman blocks his path.

TRUMAN
Albert, you make fun of everyone and everything and
then act like you deserve an award for it. That's just not
right. Get out of here before I do something I won't
regret. Again.

ALBERT
(smiles)
While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact of the
matter is I'm merely a naysayer and hatchet man in the
fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch
and would gladly take another because I choose to live
my life in the company of Ghandi and King. My
concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge,
aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a
method is love. I love you, Sheriff Truman.

Albert leaves. Truman turns to Cooper. A beat.

COOPER
Albert's path is a strange and difficult one.

Albert exits past reception where LUCY MORAN labors over the letters on the scrabble board in airing area. Cooper exits the room, finds HAWK with JAMES HURLEY, who's just up from lock-up. Cooper nods to Hawk, Hawk moves off.

COOPER
James, you aren't going to be charged. The cocaine in
your bike did not belong to you -

JAMES
That's what I was trying to tell you -

COOPER
James, I don't want to see you down here again.

JAMES
Yes sir.

COOPER
You're a Bookhouse Boy. You have an obligation to obey
the law. And you have people around you to turn to when
you're in trouble; that's an obligation, too. Stop trying
to figure it all out by yourself. Find somebody to talk
to. Talk to me if you want.
(silence; disappointed and angry)
Go home, James.

James nods and slowly exits. Cooper moves off.

COOPER
How's it going, Lucy?

LUCY
75 words, wait a minute, 76 words ... 77. Oh, oh, that's 78.

COOPER
... going good.

A thumbs up and Cooper's down the corridor. Hawk wanders over to see what Lucy's up to.

LUCY
Agent Cooper has asked me to find as many words as I
can that contain the letters B, T, and R.

HAWK
Let's see, I used to be pretty good at this.

RICHARD TREMAYNE thirties, stuffy, in an ascot and tweed jacket, enters the station. He stops to look at the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN, next to a NO SMOKING sign.

LUCY
(downcast)
My lunch date is here.

HAWK
This is the date that made Andy phone in sick?

Lucy nods. Tremayne inserts a cigarette into a holder, turns, sees Lucy, moves to them.

TREMAYNE
Ah, Lucy, there you are.

LUCY
Hello, Dick.

TREMAYNE
(sees the game)
Lucy, I have always considered you a woman of letters.

Tremayne enjoys his own wit, lights up. Hawk looks at Lucy's letters. Makes a suggestion.

HAWK
"Prohibited."

Hawk takes Tremayne's cigarette holder and snaps it in half.

TREMAYNE
(stunned, but chicken)
I say ...
(beat)
I don't believe we've met. Richard Tremayne, Horne's
Department Store, designer men's wear?

HAWK
(still in Tremayne's face)
"Robot."

Hawk goes to the conference room. Tremayne focuses on Lucy.

TREMAYNE
Did I do something to anger him? Not that native
people don't have enough reason to be angry per se -
LUCY
(cold and neutral)
Let's go to lunch.

TREMAYNE
Capital. I'm famished. We'll go dutch.

On their way out, LELAND PALMER hurries in, carrying a rolled-up wanted poster.

PALMER

Truman and Cooper are back on the giant. Hawk listens.

TRUMAN
So how tall was he exactly? Did his head hit the ceiling?

COOPER
Almost.

HAWK
I believe they have ten foot ceilings at the Great
Northern.

Leland hurries into the room.

LELAND
I'm sorry I hope I'm not interrupting -

TRUMAN
What is it, Leland?

LELAND
(holds up the poster)
This man. I know him.

COOPER
How?

LELAND
When I was a boy my Grandfather had a summer house
up at Pearl Lakes, we went there every year -

COOPER
You knew him there.

LELAND
Yes. Now, I know he wasn't a Chalbert. They were our
neighbors on one side. On the other side was a vacant
lot, then there was a white house. That's where he lived.

COOPER
Can you remember a name?

LELAND
I think ... I think it was Robertson.

Cooper looks at the letters on the blackboard, then back at Leland.

COOPER
Robert. Robertson. That's what the letters are spelling,
Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out who was in that
other house -

TRUMAN
Not many folks up there this time of year.

HAWK
I'll do what I can.

Hawk exits. Leland takes out a match book.

LELAND
Something else. He used to shoot matches at me. He'd
say, "Do you want to play with fire, little boy?"

He takes a match out of the book and puts it into his hand so that as he lights the march it will shoot out of his hand. He shoots a match that hits the window.

COOPER

Cooper walks thru the busy lobby heading towards Ben Horn's office. The ASIAN MAN watches Cooper move thru the Lobby. As Cooper gets closer the man slowly pulls a newspaper up to cover his face.

From the other direction, BEN HORNE enters, talking on a cellular phone.

BEN
I can't hear you, Jerry, turn the radio down, Jerry ... well,
then go to a room that doesn't have a live orchestra.
(pause, lowering his voice)
Much better. Listen, can you hold off Einer and the boys
till the documents on the mill are executed? Maybe a
twenty four hour troll hunt, a big circle, can you do that
for me, Little Brother? ...

COOPER
(approaching)
Mr. Home?

BEN
Fiske, fiske. Gotta go, Jer.

Ben hangs up. They speak quietly in a corner of the lobby.

COOPER
Sir, have you seen or heard anything from your daughter?

BEN
Not since I spoke to you yesterday.

COOPER
She called me late last night.

BEN
From where?

COOPER
She didn't say. She referenced seeing me in a tuxedo. I
Was wearing a tux here at the hotel the night I was shot.

BEN
Mr. Cooper, as I told you, Audrey's gone missing
before on a semi-regular basis -

COOPER
Mr. Horne, let's speak frankly. Is there trouble at home?

BEN
Do I detect a note of something outside the scope of
professional concern?

COOPER
Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance.

BEN
Acquaintance. Cooper, here's the best advice you're
going to get all week. Men fall under the spell of
Audrey's charms like ducks in a shooting gallery. It's
not pretty. If you don't want a load of buckshot in your
tailfeathers, park your jalopy outside somebody else's
window.

COOPER
(a slight retreat)
If I've overstepped my bounds, I apologize. I assure
you I'm here with nothing but the best intentions.

BEN
That much is achingly clear and not unappreciated. I'll
leave a lamp in the window and you're my first call
when she comes home to roost.

COOPER
Thank you.

BEN
No, thank you.

Horne moves on. Cooper exits, biting his tongue in self-reproachment. The Asian Man puts down his newspaper and follows Cooper out of the hotel.

A 52 PICK-UP wraps a rubber tube around the arm of AUDREY HORNE who is gagged and tied into a chair. EMORY BATTIS operates a video camera focused on Audrey. A black sheet hangs behind so that it is impossible to tell where she is. BLACKIE O'REILLY tests a syringe, while watching the video feed on a monitor.

BLACKIE
That's good, Emory. She's ready for her close-up now.

Battis zooms in as Blackie injects Audrey with the syringe, she jerks in her chair. The Pick-up unties the tube, Audrey fights the drug, then relaxes with a moan.

Blackie moves away. A nervous Battis moves to her, speaks quietly.

BATTIS
We should get rid of her. She knows I sent Laura up
here, she knows her father owns the place -

BLACKIE
With what Ben Home will pay to have his funked-up
little daughter back, I'll buy the bastard out.

BATTIS
Look, I don't want to lose my job.

BLACKIE
(a little laugh)
Honey, if this doesn't work, you'll lose a lot more than
your job.

BATTIS
We can't do this ourselves. Ben Home is dangerous.

She grabs him, holds the syringe to his throat.

BLACKIE
Listen, you spineless gasbag, you're in it, up to your
shiny pate. Stop whining and do what I tell you. We'll
have all the help we need.

He nods. She disposes of the syringe. On the tv Audrey's eyes roll back into her head as the heroin takes over.
BLACKIE (CONTINUED)
Look at her. Riding the white tiger. In a few days she
won't want to come down. Just like her father did to
me.

14. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

Tremayne wolfes down his meatloaf. Lucy nibbles.

TREMAYNE
- of course, most of the time I keep my department
running like a top, but last Christmas was such a
madhouse, absolutely no time for paper work, I had to
literally invent a system for memorizing customer
orders using mnemonic triggers. For instance you've got
someone looking for argyle socks; that would be file"s"
for sock, subheading "a" for argyle. Now it gets tricky;
a request for a vulcanized macintosh , for instance, is it
heading "r" for raingear or "w" for waterproof? My
familiarity with inventory has me leaning towards "r" -

Richard happily digs into his meatloaf.

TREMAYNE
Lucy, may I ask you something? Do you find it odd
that I don't switch my fork when I eat, that I bring it to
my mouth with my left hand?

LUCY
My mother called it "piling."

TREMAYNE
Actually, it's not odd at all, it's the European way.

He demonstrates and smiles. Pause.

LUCY
It's been six weeks, Dick. You said you were going to
call.

TREMAYNE
I know, I ... lost your number.

LUCY
I work for the Sheriff. You could dial 911.

TREMAYNE
Lucy, I do apologize. I've been so busy, honestly, I've
hardly had time to feed my cat.

LUCY
(anger surfacing)
We went out every Thursday for three months. You made
promises. You said you were going to take me to dinner
at the Space Needle in Seattle. And even though you
took me to Family Night at the Pancake Plantation
instead, I still couldn't help but think it would mean
something special, when in fact the only thing special we
did that night was drink two bottles of champagne and
end up on a display bed in Horne's home furnishings. I
admit it was daring and that made it exciting, still I
thought it would lead to more. Like a phone call.

TREMAYNE
Lucy, I feel terrible that you're upset. Really I do. Let
me make it up to you.
(beat)
For starters, I know I promised you a new dress at my
20% employee discount and I am going right back after
lunch to arrange something with Ms. Bolbo in women's
wear. Very special indeed.

LUCY
Oh yeah? How about a maternity dress?

TREMAYNE
Pardon?

LUCY

I am pregnant, Richard. Pregnant.

TREMAYNE
Preggers?

James enters the diner and slides into a booth where MADDY FERGUSON waits. She looks different; a more attractive dress, and her hair seems softer with more of a sheen.

JAMES
You look great. Cool dress.

MADDY
It's one of Laura's. It was just hanging there in her room.
Funny, I hardly remember putting, it on.

JAMES
It looks good on you. It looks, I don't know ... right.

She blushes. Looks away.

MADDY
Where's Donna?

JAMES
I don't know. She said she'd be here. Maddy, can I ask
you something? Does Donna seem different to you?

MADDY
What do you mean?

JAMES
Like, doesn't her smoking and stuff bother you? Trying
to act, I don't know, tough all of a sudden.

MADDY
James, you know her better than I do -

JAMES
She came to visit when I was in jail and ... I don't know.

MADDY
What?

JAMES
She acted like she wanted to do it with me thru the bars.
She didn't care if anybody saw us. It was weird.
Different. It wasn't like her.
(pause)
I don't know, Maddy. I don't know anything anymore.
Sometimes I feel like I should just take off. Just get on
my bike and ride.

She takes his hand.

MADDY
Running away won't solve anything.

JAMES
Sometimes the only person who seems real in a way I
can trust is you.

Donna enters the diner. Notices James and Maddy holding hands. Moves to them. They see her and let go.

JAMES
Donna, where've you been? You're late.

DONNA
I met someone from Meals on Wheels.

MADDY
Did you find out anything?

DONNA
(an edge, looking at James)
Someone real interesting.

JAMES
Those old folks must have some pretty great stories.

DONNA
This was a young man.

JAMES
Oh yeah? What's wrong with him?

DONNA
Hard to say. Other than that he's intelligent and
charming and completely different from any one I
know.

JAMES
What's that supposed to mean?

DONNA
Why don't you sit here and hold hands and try and figure
it out?

Donna leaves quickly. James and Maddy look at each other.

16. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD, the one armed man, is trying to sell shoes to Truman. Sitting on the table is a stack of posters of the Iong haired man. Gerard holds

GERARD
Now these babies are perfect for heavy field work, and
extremely versatile. Durable with a steel reinforced toe.

TRUMAN
They're not quite right.

Gerard replaces the work boot and moves to a shiny CREPE SOLED SHOE.

GERARD
Now, if the department does any parading, on the
Fourth, Veteran's day, these are your best bet. Add
some silver trimmed laces, it's an eye-catcher.

TRUMAN
Little outside my budget, Mr. Gerard.

GERARD
I understand completely. You need something practical.
A shoe for all seasons.

Gerard places the shoe on the stack of posters of the LONG HAIRED MAN. He notices Bob's picture. Truman picks out a sensible work-boor from the rack.

TRUMAN
These are more what I had in mind.

GERARD
Very popular. The lovely thing about ... lovely thing
about ...

The shoe falls our of Gerard's hand. He weaves a bit, obviously faint.

TRUMAN
You all right?

GERARD
I'm sorry, sometimes I get a bit disoriented ...

TRUMAN
Can I get you something? Water?

GERARD
If there's a bathroom, I have a medication.

TRUMAN
Let me give you a hand.

Truman helps him to the door.

17. INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Shelly waits at the reception area. Truman notices Shelly as he shows Gerard to the bathroom.

TRUMAN
Hi, Shelly, be right with you.

Mr. Gerard, it 's around the corner, second door on your
left.

GERARD
Thank you so much.

Behind them, Cooper enters the station, sees Shelly.

18. INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Truman enters a moment later.

TRUMAN
Thanks for coming down, Shelly -

SHELLY
Sheriff, I'm just going to say this. I know I don't have
to so I'm not going to say anything against Leo.

TRUMAN
We're not asking you to -

SHELLY
He's my husband. I don't have to testify against my
husband.

TRUMAN
You're not testifying, you're just giving us a statement.

SHELLY
Doc Hayward says he's too sick, what difference does it
make?

TRUMAN
Shelly, we know Leo started the fire and we know you
were there

SHELLY
I'm not going to say anything against him ... I love him.

COOPER
Okay fine, Shelly, thanks for coming in.

TRUMAN
Excuse me?

COOPER
You've obviously thought long and hard about this.
Someday, a little luck and top flight medical
attention, you'll have Leo back. The same old Leo,
strong, active ... impulsive ... that you obviously still
love. Maybe then he'll realize what a wonderful person
he married.

TRUMAN AND SHELLY
What?

COOPER
Thanks again, Shelly and best of luck.

He opens the door for her. She exits.

TRUMAN
May I ask?

COOPER
Shelly's an old fashioned girl. Like those people who
like to keep their money at home in a mattress. She
obviously wants to keep her money at home as well.

TRUMAN
The insurance money.

COOPER
Kind of makes you wonder who shot him, doesn't it?

TRUMAN
(remembering)
What two people.

They look at each other.

19. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION BATHROOM - DAY

Phil Gerard stands in front of the mirror, violently agitated. Hands shaking, he takes a SYRINGE out of an embroidered antique MEDICINE CASE. Trying to hurry an injection, he drops the syringe. Scrambling for it he accidently kicks it under a stall.

He goes in after the syringe, can't reach it. A shudder hits him. He freezes. He appears to be undergoing some kind of transformation. The stall door closes. We see his feet kicking, hear violent sounds from inside. Then silence.

The stall door swings open. Gerard exits. He's changed. His face grimer, set to some arduous task.

He looks around. Senses something.

GERARD
Bob? I know you're near.
(silence)
I'm after you now.

JEAN
Welcome back.

Audrey tries to focus on Jean.

AUDREY
Where am I?

JEAN
Here, I brought you something.
(takes a piece of hard candy from the tray)
Let me do this for you. Open wide.

Jean places the candy on Audrey's tongue. He slowly swirls it around the inside of her mouth.

JEAN (CONTINUED)
English caramels. Sugar's what you need.

Audrey sucks hungrily on his finger. He pulls the candy out of her mouth.

AUDREY
Please ...

Jean gently strokes her cheek.

JEAN
Go slow, baby. Candy's dandy. Plenty more where that
came from. My name's Jean.

Nancy lifts the cover from the tray. Jean puts the candy back in her mouth, takes a syringe off the tray.

JEAN
Sweet sleep. Feel the warmth.

He injects her off-camera. She moans, then starts to nod off. Jean and Nancy exchange a lascivious look.

Blackie and Battis watch a TAPE on one the security screens on her desk; Blackie points out Cooper on the tape, in his tux, gambling at One Eyed Jack's.

BLACKIE
That's the man.

BATTIS
Oh my God ...

BLACKIE
You know him?

BATTIS
FBI, he's FBI, I saw him at the town meeting after Laura
died, he was up here?

JEAN'S VOICE
I want him.

Jean and Nancy are standing behind them. Blackie stops the tape freezing it on Cooper.

BLACKIE
Jean Renault, Emory. Say something weak and fawning.

BATTIS
Jacques was your b-brother.

BLACKIE
And this is my sister. Nancy.

JEAN
I also had a brother named Bernard. This business cost
me them both.

BLACKIE
I told you we were going to have help.

Jean grabs Battis by the chin.

JEAN
I'm your go-between. The father pays me, my cut is
thirty percent. He never knows who snatched his baby.
And I get the man who took care of my brother. What's
his name?

He presses Battis' nose up against the screen next to Cooper's image.

BATTIS
Cooper.

JEAN
And all you have to do is give him to me.

BATTIS
M-mr. Horne can do that maybe.

NANCY
(pats Battis on the head)
You're going to be a big help, aren't you?

BATTIS
Whatever you want, want me to do.

JEAN
A tape of the girl. Get it now.

BATTIS
Yes, all right.
(Jean shoves Battis towards the door, dismisses
him)
I'd - I'd like to keep my job, at the store. That's
important to me.

JEAN
Go away.

Battis leaves. Blackie and her sister square off. Clearly they hate each other.

BLACKIE
What the hell do you bring her here for?

JEAN
She's with me.

BLACKIE
I can see she's with you.

JEAN
No: she's with me.

BLACKIE
She goes back north or this deal goes south.

NANCY

TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Josie called Pete. She'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

COOPER
Let's get her down here.

TRUMAN
Coop, I'd like a favor. I'd like to see her first. Alone.

COOPER

Harry, we can't let personal feelings interfere with our
work.

TRUMAN
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

Pause.
COOPER
Talk to her. Bring her in.

TRUMAN
She may not be involved with any of it.

COOPER
I said you could talk to her.

Hawk's knock on the doorframe breaks the tension.

HAWK
(from a notebook)
Pearl Lakes; there is a vacant lot next to the Palmer
house, and next to that is a white house that's boarded up.
No name on the mailbox.

COOPER
Run a title check.

HAWK
County's working on it, plus Power and Light's
searching their records.

COOPER
When will we hear?

HAWK
Morning, earliest.

TRUMAN
You haven't seen Gerard the shoe salesman, have you?

COOPER
The one-armed man?

TRUMAN
He came in to show me some samples. He got faint and
went to the bathroom. I came back from lunch his
sample case was gone.

COOPER
The one-armed man was here?

A late model car pulls up with man driving. COLLEEN HURLEY gets out of the passenger side. She is fortyish and gave James his good looks. Her's are on their way out.

JAMES
Mom,

Colleen walks towards her son unsteadily.

COLLEEN
There he is, the fair haired boy. Where have you been,
My fair haired boy?

JAMES
I was at school. It's a school day.

COLLEEN
God bless the public indoctrination system. Keeps the
kids off the streets, keeps the streets safe for the street
sweepers. In San Francisco, the street sweepers have an
epic quality -

JAMES
Ma ... Ma, you've been gone for a week.

COLLEEN
Kiddo, when the muse calls out, we're helpless to resist.
A poem she said, four days worth. Yes, I replied.

JAMES
Are you okay?

COLLEEN
Myself, I've been better. The poem's pretty good.

She takes out a paper with her poem on it.

COLLEEN
I learned early on. Write it down, escape the humdrum
that life has dealt you. Play with marked cards.
(puts on glasses and reads)
"Poet Lariat/Rope, rope/Bulldogged down, rodeo town/
The last of the Sabine Women---"

JAMES
I don't want to hear this.

COLLEEN
"... Sun 'goes down, rodeo town/Lariat ropes a-"

JAMES
Stop.

COLLEEN
Jimmy, are we being rude?

James pours the rest of her vodka bottle onto the ground.

COLLEEN
Fine, if it makes you feel better.

JAMES
You don't know anything.

COLLEEN
I know girl trouble when I see it. Some little logtown
siren's cut you up. I recognize the wound patterns.

JAMES
You sure can spot it, Ma.

COLLEEN
Am I right?

JAMES
Her name was Laura.

COLLEEN
Lash yourself to the mast, Odysseus. Eat the Lotus.
Forger her. Sail on. The danger for you, my darling boy,
is you'll never know whether she's an angel or a harpie sent
from hell to rend your heart, and believe me, she'll be
one or the other.

JAMES
She was both.

COLLEEN
Ah, but that's the secret, Jimmy boy, They all are.

Under DOC HAYWARD'S supervision a MALE ORDERLY and another MAN wearing a shirt that reads "Twin Peaks Security Co." finish putting metal restraints around NADINE HURLEY'S wrists, as ED HURLEY stands by.

ED
Is this really necessary?

HAYWARD
It's for her own protection Ed. She ripped two pair of
leather restraints last night like they were tissue paper.

ED
How is that possible?

HAYWARD
I ran a blood test; she's pumping out adrenaline like a
wildcat well, never seen anything like it.
You being here might calm her down. Talk to her.
Maybe sing. Does she have a favorite song?

ED
Does she have a favorite song?

HAYWARD
Short of a trip to Lourdes.

ED
Okay, Doc. But if I'm going to sing to her I'd rather it
was just the two of us.

The restraints are in place, the others leave.

DOC
I'll close the door behind me.

Doc pats Ed on the shoulder and exits.

ED
Nadine, Doc says I should sing a song to you. I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.

He takes a long look at her, starts to hum, then sing "On Top of Old Smokey." During the chorus, Nadine begins to squeeze his hand. Hard. Ed tries to pull away with no luck. He bravely continues to sing.

Nadine is now practically breaking his hand. Ed keeps singing thru the pain.

Nadine lets go of his hand and snaps the metal meshes that hold her hands. They explode off her wrists. Ed staggers back. Nadine's hands begin to clap in rhythm.

ED
Good God ...

I'm a jack and you're a jack/Steeple jacks are we...
I'm a jack and you're a jack/Steeple jacks are we
And when we climb up to the top/The cry is "Victory!"

Nadine repeats the cheer. When she finishes she is clear and beaming at Ed.

NADINE
Hi, Eddie, did you come by to pick me up?

ED
Huh?

JACOBY
Gents, this is my wife, Eolani. She lives at our place in
Hanalei. We're practising Kahuna healing.

COOPER
How do you do?

TRUMAN
M'am.

She nods graciously. A beat. Eolani begins to light candles around Jacoby's bed.

COOPER
Are you ready to be hypnotized?

JACOBY
I've been under many times. Here, read this, it's the
auto-suggestion program I use.
(hands Cooper a typed sheet; in Hawaiian)
Eolani, start the tape please.

Mrs. Jacoby hits a tape recorder that plays a tape of waves on the shore. Jacoby hands a green volcanic stone with a hole in the middle of it to Truman.

JACOBY
Sheriff, could you hold that just beyond the bed.

He relaxes, focusing on the stone that Truman is holding

JACOBY (CONTINUED)
Okay, Agent Cooper. I'm ready.

COOPER
(reading)
You are standing on a smooth green carpet of grass. Your
ball is fifteen feet from hole. Beyond the green, two
pristine white sandtraps and a lily filled pond yawn out
towards the emerald fairway. A warm whisper of a
breeze moves the flowers on the water ever so slightly.

Jacoby's eyes slowly close.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
The hole seems to slowly drift away across the green
towards the pond, carried by the summer wind. The
green grows larger and larger ... the green engulfs you,
enveloping you in a soft blanket of peace ... you stroke
the ball, it drifts towards the hole and gently drops in
its center ...

Jacoby is under.

COOPER
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?

JACOBY
Yes.

COOPER
Raise your right arm.

Jacoby does.

COOPER
We're going to the night you came to the hospital.

JACOBY
Yes.

COOPER
You are in your hospital room. You are in your room
with Jacques Renault.

JACOBY
Right.

COOPER
Do you smell anything? Burned engine oil?

JACOBY
No. I smell engine oil in the park.

COOPER
In the park where you were attacked.

JACOBY
Just before. It fills the air. Then someone hits me from
behind.

COOPER
You don't see who it is.

JACOBY
No.

COOPER
Let's go to the hospital now. You're lying in bed. Does
anyone come into the room?

JACOBY
Nurses, Doc Hayward, you, Sheriff Truman.

COOPER
What happens after we leave?

JACOBY
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay. Juggling coconuts at a
Luau. The guests are all Nigerians.

COOPER
Did anyone else come into the room?

JACOBY
Yes.

COOPER
Can you tell me about it?

JACOBY
The sound of tape ripping wakes me up. I see tape going
around Jacques wrists. Now there's a pillow on his
face. He's making a noise that almost sounds like
barking. A bell is ringing. It won't stop. Jacques stops
moving. I look up to see who's holding the pillow.

Sorry I haven't been out since the funeral. Things are
pretty strange. So, anyway, were you sleeping with this
guy Harold or what?
(pause)
He seems pretty nice. Kind of an oddball. I guess
anybody can start to seem that way when you look close
enough.
(pause)
We have to talk. Maybe you already know about me and
James, but anyway after you died we kind of got
together. This is not something I feel like I'd have to
explain to you because you probably knew how we felt
before we did. How could you be so smart about stuff
like that and so stupid about so much else?
(pause, quiets emotions, then ...)
I'm mad at you; when it was you and me and James it
kind of worked. Now you're one, I love James and
it's a mess. Your cousin Maddy's here and something's
going on with them maybe and I think I'm going to end
up losing both of you.
(pause)
I wanted so much to be like you. To have your strength
and your courage, but look what it did, look what it
did to you, Laura

As much as I loved you, Laura, most of the time we
were trying to solve your problems, and you know what,
we still are. Not James' or mine, or Maddy's, yours.
You're dead, but your problems are still hanging around.
It's like they didn't bury you deep enough.

I can't help you anymore. I love you but I can't. It's

Who, James?

James is pulling himself apart. He tries to talk but nothing comes out. She holds him.

MADDY

James pulls back a little. Their faces are close. They kiss. Gently at first and then with passion. Maddy pulls away quickly.

Hold me.

She does. Hugging with tenderness. We hear faint sound of voices off

Donna enters, sees Maddy and James pulling apart from their embrace.

MADDY

long am I supposed to tell myself that?

HAROLD
James Hurley?

DONNA
Yes. Just when I thought I had it all figured out. Why

HAROLD
You care because you care for him. Don't you?

DONNA
I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.

First, you have to stop.

What was it she always used to say to you? "Donna
Madonna, there's always manana."

DONNA
How'd you know that?

I'll get you something to drink.

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Miscommunication sometimes leads to arguments and arguments sometimes lead to fights. Anger is usually present in arguments and fights. Anger is an emotion, usually classified as a negative emotion. Negative emotions can cause severe problems in our environment and to the health of our body. Happiness, usually classified as a positive emotion, can bring good health to our body and spread positive vibrations into our environment. Sometimes when we are ill we are not on our best behavior. By ill, I mean any of the following: physically ill, emotionally ill, mentally ill, and / or spiritually ill.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY


LELAND’S POV:

SOUND EFFECT: SCREAM

Our view opens up to a cavernous dark hole from which we spirally withdraw from as we hear the blood curdling scream from a woman. As we continue to fall back we can also hear a hospital heart signature machine rhythmically beep along with the voice of a young girl that says ‘daddy.’ Our view still rotates as we back up and exit the cave to see a multitude of holes.

We retreat further and see that we were looking at an extreme closeup of a sound proofing tile on the wall. We back up further and continue to hear the screams of a woman and the voice of a young girl say ‘daddy’.

SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN steps into view from the right. The heart machine beeps faster and faster until it flatlines and becomes a tone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland.


BACK TO SCENE:

Our view ROTATES as we look at LELAND PALMER’S face. The rotation stops. Seated in a chair, LELAND is starring at the wall as SHERIFF TRUMAN tries to get his attention.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland. Leland.

LELAND finally snaps out of it and acknowledges by blinking his eyes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You have the right to an attorney.

FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER stands in the background. LELAND nods his head for no.

LELAND
I wave that right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. Do you understand?

LELAND
Yes, of course I do.

FAVORING ON LELAND, we move to PAN the room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
On Friday morning, March 3rd, did you go to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?

LELAND
Yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why did you go there?

LELAND
I was looking for someone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who were you looking for?

In the background, DR. WILL HAYWARD leans against the wall by the door.

LELAND
The man who killed my daughter.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Did you know his name?

LELAND
No. Yes, I do now. Jacques Renault.

TRUMAN leans down to face LELAND.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What ... made you think he killed Laura?

LELAND
You arrested him.

TRUMAN sternly looks at LELAND and then to the ground. COOPER bows his head.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

COOPER
He’ll plead temporary insanity.

DR. HAYWARD
We’ll need a psychiatric exam. I’ll tell you one thing, parents should not bury their children. Anyone who’s been through what Leland has has ...

COOPER stops walking and turns to DR. HAYWARD.

COOPER
You approve of murder Dr. Hayward?

DR. HAYWARD
No.

ANDY
Hey doc.

DR. HAYWARD turns around.

DR. HAYWARD
How are you Andy?

ANDY
Fine. Great. Fine.

ANDY clearly appears agitated.

DR. HAYWARD
What’s the problem?

ANDY
Its kinda’ personal.

DR. HAYWARD
I’m your doctor Andy.

ANDY
Its about my sperms ... (whispered) test.

DR. HAYWARD
Yes.

Embarrassed, ANDY becomes more agitated.

ANDY
You know. I flunked.

DR. HAYWARD
That’s not the precise term for it.

ANDY
Well, I was just wondering if its the kind of test you can take over. You know like uhm ... a driver’s exam. I mean, I’ve been wearing boxer shorts everyday just like you told me.

DR. HAYWARD
You want to give it another shot?

ANDY
Yes sir I would.

DR. HAYWARD places his bag on top of the planter between himself and ANDY and digs into the medical bag.

DR. HAYWARD
I’ll need to take a sample ... with me.

DR. HAYWARD hands ANDY a small glass vial.

ANDY
Right now?

DR. HAYWARD
Put it in a brown bag. I’ll wait in the car.

DR. HAYWARD closes his bag and walks off. ANDY, perturbed, looks at the glass vial.

MUSIC: ANDY’S THEME   7K

Holding a rolled up magazine, ANDY nervously peers out into the hallway from behind the door to the conference room. ANDY checks both directions and all appears clear so he rushes out and around the corner but smashes head on into LUCY MORAN, who just stepped out of a room and into the hall. LUCY, carrying a box full of ground coffee packets, falls to the floor dropping the box and scattering the packets all over the floor. ANDY dropped the magazine he was carrying and it is lost somewhere underneath the packets.

Nervously, ANDY helps LUCY pick up the packets and put them back in the box hoping to get his magazine before she sees it. Unfortunately for ANDY, LUCY finds it first. LUCY picks up the magazine and notices that it is a Fleshworld magazine. LUCY stares at ANDY in disbelief. A toilet can be heard FLUSHING nearby and LUCY looks at a door just behind ANDY.


LUCY’S POV:

From LUCY’S POV we view a CLOSE-UP on the sign of the door:

BACK TO SCENE:

LUCY makes the correct assumption between the magazine and the restroom. LUCY glares at ANDY and thrusts the magazine towards him. Embarrassed, ANDY grabs the magazine. LUCY picks up her box and walks away. Before she goes around the corner LUCY lets out a SNOOT.

LUCY walks into her reception office and slams a clipboard on her desk. SHERIFF TRUMAN, sitting in the reception area, turns around to see the commotion. A DEPUTY calls in a report over LUCY’S police radio.

DEPUTY (OFF SCREEN)
Lucy, I got a garbage truck here on ...

LUCY
Oh shut up.

TRUMAN turns back around to face AGENT COOPER. LUCY slams a handfull of files on a table in her office.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Our judge arrives this afternoon, Clinton Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.

COOPER sourly looks at LUCY as he digs into his coat pocket.

COOPER
Outdoors enthusiast?

COOPER enters the judge’s name into his electronic notebook, a small calculator-like device.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Last of frontiersmen. They broke the mold.

COOPER checks his electronic notebook.

COOPER
Well we got bail hearing for Leland and Leo’s competency examination.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Will Leland get bail?

COOPER
Well Harry that’s up to your state prosecutor.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’d be Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.

COOPER enters the prosecutor’s name into his electronic notebook.

COOPER
When do we hear from Hawk?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He called this morning.

TRUMAN puts his coffee mug on the nearby planter and pulls a folded piece of paper out of his shirt pocket.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now the county ... says nobody by the name Robertson ever lived next to the Palmer’s. We’ve got a current address on the last occupants, Kalispell.

DEPUTY BOB, whistling, enters the building.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We’ll check it by afternoon.

DEPUTY BOB, holding an open folder in front of his face, walks into the hallway. Out of view, we hear DEPUTY BOB collide with someone.

DEPUTY BOB (OFF SCREEN)
Hey. Watch it Andy.

COOPER turns his head towards the sound of the collision. COOPER puts his electronic notebook back in his coat pocket.

COOPER sees a small glass vial roll on the floor to a corner of the room, below a chair.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
Oh my god.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and LUCY all look at ANDY as he walks into the reception area. ANDY scans the floor for his glass vial. ANDY quickly moves to the corner of the room and gets on his knees to look under the chair. COOPER notices the soles of ANDY’S boots.

COOPER
Andy don’t move.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER.

COOPER
Where did you get those?

Still on his knees and with his head under the chair, ANDY replies ...

ANDY
Don’t make me say where these came from.

COOPER
Andy.

ANDY pulls his head out from underneath the chair and looks at COOPER.

ANDY
Please Agent Cooper this is extremely personal business.

COOPER gives ANDY a puzzled look.

COOPER
Your boots?

ANDY looks at his boots and then to COOPER.

ANDY
Oh, I’m sorry. I bought these from Philip Gerard yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.

COOPER looks at TRUMAN then kneels down to get a closer look at the heel of the boot.

COOPER
These are the same brand of boots ...


COOPER’S POV:

From COOPER’S POV we FOCUS on the heel of the boot. The heel is marked:

Circle Brand

The giant said there was a clue out there.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
But I thought it was the cocaine?

ANDY, still on his knees, looks at COOPER.

ANDY
Can I go now, Agent Cooper? I don’t know how much time I’ve got.

COOPER
If you must.

ANDY stands up and quickly runs outside. LUCY watches ANDY as he leaves the building. COOPER notices LUCY.

COOPER
Harry, what’s with Lucy?

LUCY looks at her pencil and then tosses it behind her. LUCY reaches for another pencil and then returns to her work.

Anyway, she called me this morning with a hot tip.

BENJAMIN
Mm-hmm.

LOUIS
Top secret.

BEN checks his watch.

LOUIS

M. T. Wents? M. T. Wents?

LOUIS
M. T. Wents, the travel writer.

Yes, M. T. Wents the travel writer.

Still rubbing his hands together, BEN walks away from LOUIS but continues to listen.

LOUIS
Wents travels incognito: uses only cash, no credit cards. Nobody can trace his identity ... or hers. No one at the paper even knows who he or she is.

BENJAMIN
Favorable Wents review could be quite useful.

LOUIS walks up to BEN’S side.

LOUIS
Oh he’s coming, he - he’s coming, he - he’s coming.

BENJAMIN
Keep your eye on registration. I want a hourly update. Scrutinize every check.

LOUIS
Especially if they pay cash.

BEN checks his watch.

Hank, he’s the most powerful restaurant critic in this state.

NORMA looses her smile.

Well ... you’re still friendly right. So maybe this Wents guy stops in for gas.

HANK becomes quite animate as he explains.

LUCY looks outside at ANDY and then thinks it over.

LUCY
I don’t know.

COOPER
Well Lucy, can you tell me exactly what you do want?

LUCY answers with a cry in her voice.

LUCY
I don’t know.

LUCY rushes off down the hall to the right and passes SHERIFF TRUMAN. With a coffee mug in hand, TRUMAN turns to LUCY as she passes by. COOPER walks up to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Sorry Harry, I - I was trying to help.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well it was good thought but its like trying to fix those potholes over on Highway Nine. First heavy rain and whew.

TRUMAN makes a hand gesture of a slip by gliding his hand out away from his body.

COOPER
You’ve been down this road before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure have.

COOPER looks at TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry.

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (0:00 - 0:17)

TRUMAN turns to COOPER. COOPER looks around to see if all is clear.

COOPER
I’ve got a dangerous situation. I’ve examined every possible angle and I believe there’s only one way to proceed. I need a favor. Strictly between us.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s up?

COOPER
I need one of the Bookhouse boys. Your best man. It would be better if you didn’t know why.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, I’ve steered clear when you asked me to. Is there anything I need to know about this one?

COOPER
Absolutely not.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’ll set it up. 9:30 at the Roadhouse.

COOPER
Thanks Harry.

COOPER walks off. TRUMAN watches COOPER leave.

Looking outside through the glass in the front doors to the building, ANDY is still outside waiting. Cold, ANDY has his arms folded and shivers. A crack of thunder can be heard in the background.

A CUSTOMER enters the diner. The CUSTOMER is a large man wearing a black cowboy hat. NORMA and HANK walk into view from opposite sides and meet in the center of our view, framing the CUSTOMER in the distant background. NORMA and HANK speak quietly to each other.

NORMA
It must be him.

HANK
Here we go.

HANK walks off to the kitchen. NORMA walks up to the CUSTOMER.

NORMA
Good evening sir, welcome to the Double R Diner.

CUSTOMER
Thanks, think I could have a booth?

NORMA
Of course, right this way.

NORMA guides the CUSTOMER to one of the booth along the right wall. The CUSTOMER takes a seat.

NORMA
We have two very delicious specials this evening ...

CUSTOMER
I’m sure you do but I’ll have a cheeseburger, medium; a coke and some fries.

NORMA
Very good.

NORMA rolls her eyes in disappointment. NORMA walks off to the kitchen. We MOVE BACK to see TOAD sitting in a booth right behind the CUSTOMER. TOAD wears a dirty napkin tucked in at the top of his shirt like a bib. TOAD licks his thumb as HANK walks up to him.

HANK
Excuse me, Toad.

TOAD
(mouth full) Hmm.

HANK
Why don’t we finish this up in the kitchen.

TOAD
(mouth full) Hmm. Mm-hmm.

HANK grabs TOAD’S plate, picks it up and walks toward the kitchen. TOAD follows HANK.

HANK
Get in the back and don’t touch anything.

NORMA places the food order tab onto the short order hanging clip for the cook. HANK walks up to NORMA.

NORMA
He only wanted a cheeseburger.

HANK peers over to the CUSTOMER then back to NORMA.

HANK
It must be some kind of food critic trick.

NORMA
You think so?

HANK
Absolutely yeah, yeah. I think ...

The CUSTOMER, with his hat and coat removed, clears his throat to get NORMA’S and HANK’S attention as he walks up to them. HANK and NORMA turn to the CUSTOMER and smile.

CUSTOMER
Bathroom?

The CUSTOMER gestures that he would like to wash his hands by rubbing his hands together.

HANK
Oh right this way sir.

HANK leads the CUSTOMER to the bathroom. NORMA smiles as she listens to HANK.

HANK
Uh we just finished painting it and uh it looks really nice. Its completely quiet. Yeah, just follow me. Oh sorry.

Behind NORMA in the background, TOAD is eating out of one of the large cooking pots.

TOAD
(barely intelligible) Hmm, good stuff.

NORMA turns around and sees TOAD eating out of the pot with a big stirring spoon.

NORMA
Toad!

NORMA rushes into the kitchen.

NORMA
Toad. Get out of my ...

With his mouth full, TOAD backs off as NORMA enters the kitchen.

TOAD
Mmm. Uhh. Nahh nahhh.

HANK walks back out into the diner. HANK looks over to the kitchen. All clear, HANK moves over to the CUSTOMER’S jacket. Using a rag, HANK pretends to be cleaning the booth as he reaches into the pocket of the jacket and takes out a wallet. HANK hides the wallet under his rag and walks away.

We FOCUS on a sign, in the shape of a soup kettle, that reads:

ASK ABOUT OUR SPECIALS

We PAN RIGHT to FOCUS on a chocolate pie under glass. We MOVE UP and look over the pie to see DONNA and MADELEINE FERGUSON sitting opposite each other at a booth. DONNA is smoking a cigarette.

MADELEINE
Thanks for coming. I ... I didn’t know ...

DONNA
Know what?

MADELEINE
I didn’t know if you were mad or not. I mean, how mad.

DONNA
I’ll survive.

MADELEINE leans forward.

MADELEINE
Donna, there’s nothing going on between me and James.

DONNA
What if there is? I mean, who said James and I couldn’t see other people? I certainly didn’t.

MADELEINE
(disbelief; smiles) Huh, are you saying you’re seeing someone else?

DONNA
Maddy I need your help.

MADELEINE shakes her head.

MADELEINE
How?

DONNA
Harold Smith has Laura’s diary.

MADELEINE
(confused) Hah, I thought the sheriff had Laura’s diary.

DONNA
Harold said that Laura kept a second diary that I didn’t know about and he’s got it.

MADELEINE looks away.

MADELEINE
God. We have to tell James about this.

DONNA
If Laura did have a secret diary and Harold’s got it, I’m going to get it with or without you. Tell that to James.

MADELEINE and DONNA uneasily stare at each other. We ZOOM OUT and FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of HANK’S face as he steps into view. HANK opens the wallet he stole and looks down.

Positioned near the ceiling, we look down at the living room. SHERIFF TRUMAN sits on the arm of a sofa chair. JOSIE enters the room directly behind him wearing a thin, black camisole covering a thin, black negligee that has a slit that runs to her upper thigh. JOSIE walks in front of TRUMAN and pulls the camisole down, revealing her bare shoulders.

JOSIE
I know I paid too much for it but I just fell in love with it. I heard the salesperson say the only reason we’re still in business is because Josie Packard buys retail.


BACK TO SCENE:

JOSIE sits on TRUMAN’S right knee. TRUMAN looks JOSIE over.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I like it.

JOSIE

JOSIE puts her hands on TRUMAN’S face. Lightning brightens the room and thunder crashes just outside the lodge.

JOSIE

JOSIE
Yes, why are you so suspicious. Look at this blouse.

JOSIE gestures to her multitude of boxes.

JOSIE
You think I got them at Cash and Carry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why didn’t you tell me you were going?

JOSIE
You know I had to get away, I was afraid.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know, afraid of Ben and Catherine.

JOSIE
You know that?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
And now Catherine’s dead.

JOSIE stands up.

JOSIE
Harry? You don’t think I ...

TRUMAN holds his arms out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t know what to think. I don’t know.

JOSIE
You think I could burn the mill? That I would ruin everything of mine?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There’s insurance money.

JOSIE puts a hand to her mouth.

JOSIE
My god. How could you. How could you think of such terrible things. You’ve hurt me so.

JOSIE clutches at her camisole and walks away. The room fills with blue light and thunder whips outside the lodge. TRUMAN walks to JOSIE. JOSIE has taken a seat on the couch by a window. TRUMAN takes a seat next to JOSIE.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I was just so worried.

JOSIE
I’m sorry.

JOSIE guides TRUMAN’S arms around her back and hugs him.

JOSIE
Hold me. Hold me. Take me.

TRUMAN lets go, moves back slightly and holds JOSIE’S face.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?

JOSIE
I want you to take me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie? Josie, why? Why didn’t you tell me?

JOSIE kisses TRUMAN and then guides his hands to her camisole.

JOSIE
Tear it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What?

JOSIE
Tear it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN hungrily tears JOSIE’S camisole in two from the back. TRUMAN and JOSIE embrace and kiss. JOSIE leans back on the couch. TRUMAN lies above her, kissing her. JOSIE runs her hands over TRUMAN’S back.

JOSIE
I want you. I need you.

We PAN up to the window.

JOSIE
I want you more then my life.

Lightning flashes and through the open Venetian blinds a figure is illuminated just outside the window looking inside the lodge and down at JOSIE and TRUMAN on the couch. Its JONATHAN KUMAGAI standing outside in the rain as thunder roars.

BACK TO SCENE:

Standing near the coffee station, LUCY takes a drink from her coffee mug and holds it close to keep warm. Lightning flashes and thunder rattles. The lights flicker and then go out but only briefly as the power return. LUCY looks up at the lights and her eye’s widen.

In the background behind LUCY, a MAN enters the building. The MAN takes off his wet cowboy hat and slaps it against his dover. The MAN is JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, a tall man with short gray hair.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Hi good looking. Who do you have to grease to get some coffee around here?

LUCY walks up to STERNWOOD.

LUCY
Judge Sternwood, hello your honor.

LUCY and STERNWOOD meet in front of the reception office window.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Lucy, your a cool drink of water for road weary eyes. What’s your secret?

LUCY bows her head slightly.

LUCY
(apprehensive) I’d rather not talk about it sir.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
(understanding) Give us a hug?

LUCY smiles and gives STERNWOOD a big hug. STERNWOOD holds LUCY.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Uh, life is hard dear. Still in all, its harder in most places then in Twin Peaks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the building.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Clinton. Sorry I’m late.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Oh I only just arrived.

STERNWOOD and TRUMAN shake hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good to see ya’.

TRUMAN appears distant. Squinting, STERNWOOD notices.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
What's her name Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(confused) What?

JUDGE STERNWOOD
You got the look of a man with filly trouble, son. If they don’t take to saddle you’ve got two options and I won’t bore you with either one of them.

TRUMAN gives STERNWOOD a discerning eye. AGENT COOPER, adjusting his suit jacket, steps out of SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office.

COOPER
Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Uh Judge Sternwood, Special Agent Dale Cooper FBI.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
How are you lad?

COOPER
Your honor.

COOPER and STERNWOOD shake hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You two should have a lot in common.

TRUMAN gives COOPER a discerning eye as well.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Sid will bring in the court calender as soon as the Winnebago’s tanked up. (to TRUMAN) You wanna break the seal on that Irish you stashed for me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right this way.

TRUMAN leads the way and walks off.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of this world?

COOPER
Heaven sir.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well this week heaven includes arson, multiple homicides and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.

STERNWOOD follows TRUMAN.

COOPER
Well heaven is a large and interesting place sir.

COOPER walks off. LUCY walks to window of her reception office. RICHARD ‘DICK’ TREMAYNE enters the building. LUCY notices DICK and tries to rush off, hoping not to be seen.

DICK
Lucy?

LUCY stops in her tracks.

LUCY
Dick.

DICK
Lucy I haven’t slept. I can’t eat. I’ve been absolutely miserable.

DICK walks right up behind LUCY. LUCY turns around to face DICK.

LUCY
What?

DICK
I’ve been a fool, a cad the way I’ve behaved. I’m deeply, deeply ashamed.

LUCY stares into DICK’S eyes and hold her hands to her chest.

LUCY
You are?

DICK
I’ve been over it in my mind a million times and what I’ve come to is this. I have to, no I must do the right thing.

LUCY
You must?

DICK reaches into the interior pocket of his trench coat and pulls out an envelope. DICK hands the envelope to LUCY.

DICK
Its everything I could scrape together. I’m completely accurate.

LUCY opens the envelope.

LUCY
What is this?

DICK
Six hundred and fifty dollars. I called around. I’ve been told its more than adequate.

LUCY
For what?

DICK
For the ... to take care of ... you know ... the little problem.

LUCY wads the envelope and puts it in DICK’S hand.

LUCY
Richard, here’s what you’re going to do: take your money; put it back in your wallet or your pocket; turn around and walk through both sets of doors, the second one sticks sometimes; go out into the parking lot; get in your car; turn the key and NEVER EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!

DICK opens his mouth to say something but LUCY interrupts him.

LUCY
SAY ONE MORE WORD AND I’LL SCREAM! Please, please.

DICK tries to speak again. LUCY jumps slightly and throws her hands to her mouth to muffle her nearly hysterical scream. DICK quietly exits. LUCY goes into SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office and slams the door behind herself.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY walks around the corner from the hallway escorting LELAND to the conference room. ANDY hears LUCY yelling in the office. ANDY stops by the door and leans toward it to try to catch what LUCY is saying but he has to move on. ANDY and LELAND walk up the hall.

We slowly ZOOM IN on JUDGE STERNWOOD as he speaks.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
I know you to be a fine, descent man and a capable attorney. And to see you under these circumstances is ... is dreadful for us all. Well the uh law provides a structure to guide through perilous and trying times but it requires us a submission to its procedures and higher purposes. Before we assume our respective roles, in this enduring drama, just let me say that uh ... when these frail shadows we inhabit now .. have quit the stage ... we’ll meet ... and raise a class again together ... in Valhalla.

LELAND turns to leave but quickly turns back to JUDGE STERNWOOD and nods his head.

LELAND

LELAND and ANDY exit the room. JUDGE STERNWOOD, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER remain seated.

JUDGE STERNWOOD

COOPER nods his agreement with STERNWOOD’S statement. COOPER and STERNWOOD take a sip from their cups of coffee. A young woman, SID enters the room. SID has long dark brown hair and wears a very colorful jacket. SID carries another jacket over her arm and the court calender in a portfolio.

SID
We’re ready to roll.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well, hi ya’ Sid.

TRUMAN stands up. COOPER quickly follows suit and stands up. SID looks at TRUMAN.

SID

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Uh Sid uh, say hello to Special Agent Cooper.

SID
Agent Cooper.

COOPER
How do you do?

STERNWOOD stands up and walks over to SID. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN give each other a look - a questioning gesture dealt towards STERNWOOD and SID.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well gentlemen, we’ve been uh ... eight hours on the road. Sid and I are going to pile it over to the Great Northern, hook up the Winne’ and dine in the Timber Room. See ya’ in court.

JUDGE STERNWOOD leaves the room. SID closes the door behind herself as she leaves with STERNWOOD. COOPER asks TRUMAN ...

COOPER
Wife?

TRUMAN takes a drink from his coffee mug.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Uh - uh, law clerk.

COOPER looks back to the door where SID left.

The YOUNG WOMAN nods her head for yes. BEN calls to her.

KATRINA turns around and stands beside the YOUNG WOMAN. SOMEONE stands very close just to the right of our view but out of focus.

LOUIS digs into her pocket and pulls out a business card.

LOUIS
And if you would like to treat yourself to some of our outstanding local cuisine while you’re here I would recommend the Double R Diner. Ask for Norma.

LOUIS hands the card to MR. TOJAMURA.

There is a loud KNOCK at the front door in the dark interior of the diner. In his pajamas, HANK walks into the dark and empty diner towards the front door. Lighting brightly flashes the interior.

HANK
ALRIGHT I’M COMING! ALRIGHT!

Thunder rattles as HANK reaches the front door of the diner and opens it.

HANK
HEY WE’RE NOT OP...

There is nobody there. HANK looks around then closes the door and starts to head back. Halfway past the island counter, the power goes out and all the lights on the appliances and the interior go out. With light only coming in through the windows from the outside, HANK opens a nearby cabinet drawer and retrieves a large metal flashlight. HANK slams the flashlight into his hand and turns it on just as a bright streak of lighting illuminates the interior. HANK quickly turns around and points the light at the face of a PERSON standing in the dark. Thunder roars and lighting brightens the interior as we FOCUS on the face of JONATHAN, who is dressed in black with a black hat and dark sunglasses.

HANK
What’s the deal?

JONATHAN removes his sunglasses. HANK holds the flashlight up high in his left hand and shines it down on JONATHAN’S face. HANK move out from the island counter and towards JONATHAN.

HANK
Do I know you?

Lighting fills the room. HANK throws a punch with his right hand. JONATHAN quickly makes a move and throws HANK over the island counter. HANK gets back up and leans on the counter.

HANK
Okay.

HANK moves out from behind the island counter and towards JONATHAN. HANK swings the metal flashlight at JONATHAN once and then twice. HANK throws another right punch but JONATHAN makes another move that sends HANK flipping over onto the floor. HANK’S feet hit a nearby table and knock down a basket full of plates and utensils that break on the floor.

HANK quickly stands back up. HANK kicks his right foot into the air towards JONATHAN, misses and then throws a right punch. JONATHAN grabs HANK’S right arm, punches him in the stomach and then throws a punch into HANK’S face that sends him flying into the air and onto his back. JONATHAN reaches down and picks up the flashlight. HANK lifts his head from the floor but does not stand up. JONATHAN flashes the light down on HANK’S face.

HANK
Listen, I think I’m just going to lay here for a while.

HANK stretches his hand out in front of his face to block the glare of the flashlight from hitting his eyes. A small trail of blood runs from the corner of his mouth.

HANK
What? What?!

JONATHAN leans down and runs his thumb over the blood at the corner of HANK’S mouth. HANK quickly jerks away and grabs at JONATHAN’S hand. JONATHAN clenches HANK’S fingers into his fingers and palm of his hand. JONATHAN and HANK’S thumbs are pressed together with blood.

JONATHAN
Blood brother, next time I take your head off.

JONATHAN lifts the flashlight up high into the air and then quickly swings down and smashes it beside HANK.

Sometimes nature plays tricks on us and we imagine we are something other than what we truly are. Is this a key to life in general? Or the case of the two-headed schizophrenic?

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

We FOCUS on the bedstand as the alarm of a collapsible traveling alarm clock goes off. FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER extends his hand and turns off the alarm.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:40 - 3:48)

COOPER reaches out further and fumbles around for his miniature tape recorder. COOPER picks it up, brings it to his mouth and clicks it on.

COOPER
Diane, 6:42 am, approximately.

With some of his hair whipped up from his sleeping position, COOPER gets up and sits on the edge of the bed near the bedstand.

COOPER
I dreamed I was eating a large, tasteless gumdrop.

COOPER picks up an ear plug off of the bedstand and looks it over.

COOPER
I awoke to realize that I was aggressively munching on one of my Ear Pillow silicone ear plugs. Hence the tastelessness.

COOPER removes the other ear plug out of his ear and places them both on the bedstand.

COOPER
Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on my afternoon coffee consumption.

COOPER gets up and picks up a pillow.

COOPER
Uhmm, a persistent soreness in the rib area which I’m treating each morning with fifteen extra minutes of yoga discipline. After which, thankfully, the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac in a distant suburb of my conscious mind.

COOPER walks around the bed to the other side of the room and drops the pillow on the floor right next to the wall.

COOPER
I’m going to begin today with a headstand.

COOPER bends down and places his miniature tape recorder on the floor near the pillow. Next, COOPER places his hands in front of the pillow and quickly bends his head down and throws his legs up. With his back to the wall, COOPER balances himself.

COOPER
Ohh, Diane I am now upside down.


COOPER’S POV:

From COOPER’S POV we get an upside down and unfocused view underneath the bed.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Ahh, mind becoming porous.

The day’s task coming into focus, objects growing clearer.

Directly ahead, laying on the floor beneath the bed is a white envelope.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER lowers his legs and uprights himself to sit on the floor. COOPER moves near the bed, reaches for the note and grabs it. Still in his pajamas, COOPER takes a seat on the floor with his back to the foot of the bed. COOPER picks up his mini tape recorder and looks over the envelope.

COOPER
Diane, the Giant was right. I did forget something.


COOPER’S POV:

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (0:14 - 1:14)

From COOPER’S POV, we view the front of the envelope. Written in script, the envelope is addressed to:

My Special Agent
COOPER quickly opens the small envelope and unfolds a small note. It reads:

I've gone North.
Jack might have
the answer.
,Love Audrey
COOPER reads it out loud.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
I’ve gone North. Jack might have the answer. Love Audrey.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Wearing a concerned expression, DEPUTY TOMMY THE ‘HAWK’ HILL enters the building. With a coffee mug in one hand and a donut in the other, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN walks out from the coffee station and up to HAWK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey, I thought we lost you to the Kalispell woods.

HAWK
Two retired female school teachers live in that house next to the Palmers. They have no memory of a gray haired man.

TRUMAN eats his donut.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hmm.

HAWK
I had to drink three pots of chamomile tea to find that out. Which reminds me, will you excuse me for a minute.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

HAWK
Thanks.

HAWK rushes off. LUCY MORAN walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mmm, keep looking for the one-armed man. We’ve got to find him.

LUCY puts on a red coat.

LUCY
Excuse me sheriff, I just wanted to say good-bye because, as you know, I’m going down to Tacoma for today to visit my sister Gwen and her husband Larry, who had a baby last week.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

LUCY
That is Gwen had the baby, Larry’s the father. You remember it was a boy. Well anyway, as soon as the candored temp girl gets here I’ll explain the phones and the coffee and the ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN

TRUMAN puts his coffee and donut down in the coffee station.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy its okay.

LUCY
... and the wag ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN picks up LUCY’S suitcase and escorts her toward the front door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy we’ve got it covered.

At the door, LUCY stops and looks at TRUMAN.

LUCY
No, she should have been here by now. I can stay and at least show her ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy don’t worry, just go.

COOPER appears at the first set of doors at the entrance. SHERIFF TRUMAN extends the suitcase to LUCY.

LUCY
Sometimes the candor girls can’t. But sheriff.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We’ve got it covered.

LUCY grabs her suitcase and walks out. Having not entered yet, COOPER holds the door open for LUCY. As she passes him, COOPER says ...

COOPER
Have a safe trip Lucy.

LUCY
Thank you.

LUCY walks off. TRUMAN holds the door open for AGENT COOPER as he walks inside.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good morning Coop.

COOPER
Harry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What is the word on our delivery tonight?

COOPER
We won’t need it. We’ve got the jump on them.

AGENT COOPER brandishes a smile.

COOPER

CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

BOBBY BRIGGS sits in a wheelchair and has a harness around his waist that is connected to a chain that is hooked to a small lifting crane. MR. TIM PINKLE stands beside BOBBY adjusting the equipment that operates the lifting crane. BOBBY’S interest lie in the magazine, ‘Shooting’ - a magazine about guns, he is holding as MR. PINKLE rambles on about the lifting crane.

MR. PINKLE
You see the Porto-Patient will allow you to fluently uh transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson. Uh allowing him to ... to even uh ...

SHELLY JOHNSON, well dressed in black and smoking a cigarette, watches on.

MR. PINKLE
... go outside and - and sit and ... and experience what he can of nature.

BOBBY diverts his attention to MR. PINKLE.

BOBBY
Mr. Pinkle I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest possible experience of life.

MR. PINKLE takes the magazine from BOBBY and tosses it aside. MR. PINKLE pats BOBBY on the back.

MR. PINKLE
Well that’s what we’re here for.

MR. PINKLE tugs the harness which gives BOBBY a jerk.

MR. PINKLE
Okay let’s give it one more.

SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to install the ramp?

SHELLY gestures to the front door.

MR. PINKLE
Well ... sure, of course ... uh of course. As a matter of fact I already have some uh ... uh some plywood ramp bo...

BOBBY snaps his fingers to correct him.

MR. PINKLE
... uh pinewood ramp boards that I’ll install tomorrow. Absolutely, that is a very good suggestion. Now I think we are ready to go. Finally, here we go alright.

MR. PINKLE moves over to the switch that operates the crane and presses the button but the motor doesn’t work. So MR. PINKLE presses it again and again.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BELT AND MOTOR

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the belt and motor of the lifting crane as MR. PINKLE pushes the button. The belt moves slightly as the motor engages but does not run completely.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
That’s a new wrinkle.

MR. PINKLE turns to BOBBY.

MR. PINKLE
(whispered) I can’t believe it it was working just so perfectly yesterday.

MR. PINKLE turns back to the switch and hits it with the bottom of his fist.

MR. PINKLE
Come on, come ... sometimes you’ve got to be tough with these things. You got to hit it hard. A machine is like a woman we always say at the machine shop. Come on.

MR. PINKLE continues to push the button. Suddenly it roars to life and BOBBY unexpectedly gets jerked up into the air and then dropped back into his seat.

SHELLY
Oh Bobby are you okay?!

BOBBY quickly stands up and wrestles with the harness to remove it from himself.

BOBBY
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle a cold drink please?

MR. PINKLE
A diet soda please that would be great.

BOBBY walks over to MR. PINKLE and corners him against the wall. Towering over MR. PINKLE, BOBBY snaps his fingers from both hands around his face.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:40 - 3:48)

BOBBY
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle. This thing is a death trap. I told you we have to keep him alive.

MR. PINKLE
Look the insurance companies don’t exactly payoff like the slots you know. After we take our cuts we have only money for this or a first rate wheel barrel.

BOBBY hits the wall with the palm of his right hand. SHELLY returns with an open bottle of soda pop and hands it over to MR. PINKLE.

MR. PINKLE
Oh thank you very much.

MR. PINKLE looks the bottle over.

MR. PINKLE
Oh thanks oh uh.

MR. PINKLE walks over to his tool case.

SHELLY
Bobby?

SHELLY motions to BOBBY to follow her to the next room.

SHELLY and BOBBY walk into the kitchen. They both stand close together face-to-face.

SHELLY
I’ve got to meet with this lawyer.

BOBBY
The hearings today right?

MR. PINKLE shouts from the next room.

MR. PINKLE (OFF SCREEN)
Be just another second folks!

SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?

BOBBY and SHELLY stare into each others eye’s. BOBBY gently caresses her face and slowly moves in for a kiss but is interrupted by MR. PINKLE in the next room.

We FOCUS on MR. PINKLE as he sits in the wheelchair wearing the harness that is connected to the lifting crane. MR. PINKLE reaches over and turns on the machine. Slowly, and noisily, MR. PINKLE gets lifted into the air.

MR. PINKLE
Oh that’s it. Come and take a look, you can see it. Works just fine.

We FOCUS back on BOBBY and SHELLY. BOBBY smiles at SHELLY as he holds her jaw gently with his fingertips.

BOBBY
Come outside with me. He can let himself out.

SHELLY turns around and BOBBY puts his hands on her shoulders as they walk off.

We FOCUS on MR. PINKLE suspended in the lifting harness as the lifting crane rotates the crane to a position over the bed.

MR. PINKLE
Bobby we’re doing real good.

But the crane doesn’t stop over the bed and slams MR. PINKLE against the wall.

MR. PINKLE
Uh okay that’s enough uh.

After slamming MR. PINKLE against the wall the crane rotates in the opposite direction and slams him into wall again. Again, the lifting crane rotates in the opposite direction and slams MR. PINKLE into the wall above the bed. As the crane swings MR. PINKLE around once more, he tries to reach out to the controls.

MR. PINKLE
Hey Bobby uh Bob - Bob I can’t reach the switch. Bobby I’ve got a problem here.

BACK TO SCENE:

Seated behind a desk that is centered on the stage is JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD. To the left of him is seated his law clerk, SID. To the right of him is the COURT RECORDER. The stage has the red curtains drawn behind them and two flags are positioned behind the Judge’s desk.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder in the first degree. The defense has requested bail.

In the main room, all the tables have been put aside and the chairs have been placed in rows facing the stage. LELAND PALMER, dressed in a gray suit, sits in the front row. MADELEINE FERGUSON and SARAH PALMER sit together two rows behind LELAND.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
This pretrial hearing is to determine whether that bail will be granted.

Separated by an aisle, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN sit to the left of LELAND. AGENT COOPER sits in the row behind ANDY. TOAD sits behind COOPER eating away at a hamburger.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mister Prosecutor.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY DARYL LODWICK gets up from his chair where he was seated at a table positioned between the rows of chairs and the stage. To the right of him sits the defense attorney at a different table. LODWICK walks near the stage and paces as he speaks.

LODWICK
We the people of the state of Washington move that the defendant be denied bail. On the basis of: one, the great seriousness of the crime for which he has been accused; two, the apparently premeditated nature of this act; and three, the oft witnessed instability of Mr. Palmer during the period following the death of his daughter.

SARAH looks at the expression on her husband’s face.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:03 - 4:34)

Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up. ANDY is drawing on a sketch pad.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your honor, Leland Palmer is a well known, well liked, well respected member of this community.

Pleased by the comment, LELAND looks over to SHERIFF TRUMAN as does SARAH.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
His roots go way back. His grandfather, Joshua Palmer, brought the family here more than 75 years ago

Seated at the bar, BENJAMIN HORNE tosses peanuts into his mouth as he listens to the trial.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your honor, no one ... can know ... what its like to lose a daughter the way Leland did. That’s all.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks over the sketch ANDY made.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP SKETCH

We view a CLOSE-UP of the sketch ANDY has been working on. The sketch is a black outline of the back of LELAND’S head.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)

There is no response.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)
So witnesses for the defense, thank you gentlemen.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER bends forward and pokes his head between ANDY and TRUMAN to take a look at sketch.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(whispered to ANDY) Well why don’t you try for a little more face then that.


ANDY’S POV:

Through ANDY’S POV we look over to LELAND and see mostly the back end of his left profile.

At the door, HAROLD SMITH unlocks the deadbolt and opens the door to reveal DONNA HAYWARD holding a food tray. HAROLD holds a glass of wine in his right hand. HAROLD smiles at DONNA.

HAROLD
Hi.

DONNA
Hi.

HAROLD
Thank you.

HAROLD grabs the tray from DONNA and places it on top of a cabinet just to the left of her. HAROLD lifts the metal cover off the plate of food.

HAROLD
Oh ... mmm.

Still standing by the door and facing each other, HAROLD takes a sip from his glass.

HAROLD
So, what’s behind those deep blue eyes today?

DONNA
I’ve got a proposition for you. Share my life with you, tell it to you, part of your living novel. If you let me read Laura’s diary.

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   32K

HAROLD walks into the room and thinks it over.

HAROLD
Its intriguing.

HAROLD turns back to face DONNA.

HAROLD
I’ll read it to you ... but it mustn’t physically leave this room.

DONNA
Acceptable.

HAROLD motions to DONNA to enter. They both walk into the room.

HAROLD
You’ll start?

DONNA turns to face HAROLD.

DONNA
Of course.

HAROLD
A bargain has been struck.

HAROLD gestures to DONNA to take a seat on the chair. DONNA removes her long black coat, to reveal a pink top and blue skirt, and takes a seat on the chair. HAROLD moves over to the bookcase behind her and bends down. HAROLD positions his right hand on a triangular headed wooden peg that holds a shelf in place. He turns the peg and the shelf and backing move forward. This small cache reveals half a dozen small books. HAROLD looks over his shoulder to DONNA. DONNA had been watching and quickly turns away. HAROLD grabs one book out of the cache and closes it back up.

HAROLD stands back up, grabs his glass of wine and walks over to his desk that is positioned in front of DONNA. HAROLD smiles at DONNA as he passes her. HAROLD takes a seat at the desk, grabs a pen, and writes on the front of a Mead composition pad.

HAROLD
Donna ... Hayward.

HAROLD opens the small book to the first page, creases it down, places a fine cloth bookmark on that page and writes the date.

HAROLD
Begin.

DONNA
Alright. I’m from Twin Peaks. Actually, I was born here. My father delivered me, he’s a doctor. Where are you from?

HAROLD is caught off guard by the question.

HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. (slightly embarrassed) Well, actually, I grew up in books.

DONNA boldly leans forward.

DONNA
There’s things you can’t get in books.

HAROLD
There’s things you can’t get anywhere ... but we dream that they can be found in other people.

Slightly embarrassed, HAROLD smiles.

HAROLD
Continue.

DONNA
Maybe our dreams are real.

HAROLD turns to look at DONNA, slightly amazed by her statement. DONNA stares at HAROLD but quickly and unexpectedly grabs LAURA’S diary from table.

DONNA
My turn.

DONNA stands up and backs up toward the door. Concerned, HAROLD stands up.

HAROLD
What are you doing?

DONNA
(smiling) Maybe I’ll read it out here on the lawn.

HAROLD moves toward DONNA but she backs up closer to the door.

HAROLD
Please, we only just started.

DONNA
Why don’t you come with me. Come on, what’s there to be afraid of?

DONNA opens the door and steps outside.

DONNA
Come on.

BACK TO SCENE:

JUDGE STERNWOOD sits behind a desk that is centered on the stage. STERNWOOD’S law clerk, SID, sits to the left of him. The court recorder sits to the right of STERNWOOD. The stage has the red curtains drawn behind them and has two flags positioned behind the Judge’s desk.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
The defense will continue with its evidence. If you would Mr. Racine.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY MR. RACINE stands up. MR. RACINE and his female law clerk, who are oddly dressed in same the brown suits and ribbon ties, are sitting together at a table just in front of the stage. To the left of MR. RACINE sits the district attorney at a different table. MR. RACINE holds up a computer print out.

RACINE
You can see from these EEG’s, this chart here which is actually of my own head ...


INSERT: CLOSE-UP EEG CHART

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the EEG chart and see that lines that represent brain activity are of varying scribbled wavy lines.

RACINE (OFF SCREEN)
... is intended to show normal brain activity ...


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. LODWICK stands up in protest.

LODWICK
Objection to the use of the word normal, your honor.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well he’s close enough. Objection overruled.

Disappointed, MR. LODWICK sits back down.

RACINE
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson and shows minimal activity.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP EEG CHART

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of another EEG chart and see that lines that represent brain activity are nearly straight lines instead of varying scribbled waves.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. RACINE hands the EEG charts to SID who passes the charts to JUDGE STERNWOOD.

RACINE
Previously submitted medical reports states that Mr. Johnson has suffered diffuse brain damage. He doesn’t currently even have the perspicacity to take the standard CST competency test.

MR. RACINE walks across the front of the stage and up to the poster of LEO JOHNSON. MR. RACINE points to the enlarged photograph of LEO’S picture while in a coma.

RACINE
We therefore submit that trying this individual constitute a mockery of the justice system. A proceeding that the unfortunate young man would not even faintly comprehend.

JUDGE STERNWOOD nods his approval of the argument.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mister prosecutor.

In the row of chairs behind the tables, SHERIFF TRUMAN sits behind the prosecutor table. SHELLY sits behind the table of the defense. AGENT COOPER sits behind SHELLY. MR. LODWICK sternly looks at MR. RACINE, scratches his beard and then stands up.

LODWICK
I know Leo Johnson isn’t in very good shape. On the surface it might seem ridiculous to make him stand trial but the trial does more then just punish the wrongdoer. It also brings a feeling of justice and retribution to a community.

JUDGE STERNWOOD rolls his eyes.

LODWICK
Among the various crimes Leo Johnson is suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort that can wound an entire town. As long as Leo Johnson carries a breath he is ...

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright, alright.

LODWICK
... as eminently deserving of a trial ...

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright. Alright!

LODWICK
... as this community is of a sense of resolution!

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright! Now have a seat Mr. Lodwick.

Again disappointed, MR. LODWICK rubs his beard and takes a seat.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Now you fellas can catch your breath. Uh I uh ... am going to need to deliberate.

JUDGE STERNWOOD stands up.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Uh Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the pleasure of your company.

COOPER raises his left hand.

We FOCUS on SID as she walks behind the bar of the Roadhouse. JUDGE STERNWOOD, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER walk over to the bar and take a seat.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Sid, can you fix us up with three black Yukon sucker punches?

SID
Yes your honor.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked me in the eye. I didn’t expect him to press on the murder charge.

COOPER passes out napkins.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?

COOPER
No sir, I don’t believe he is.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Harry, what’s the temperature of the town, uh do they want a trial or a lynching?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Hmm well they don’t need a circus ... and this poor bastard, he seems to be a heady cabbage. Thoughts Cooper?

SID places a tall straight glass, half filled with a dark liquid and the top half filled with a blue foamy head, in front of each of them.

COOPER
I feel the killer with eventually be apprehended.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
You have to watch these. They sneak up on ya’.

COOPER picks up the glass and looks at its blue foamy contents. SHERIFF TRUMAN pats JUDGE STERNWOOD’S left arm.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks Clinton.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gets up and leaves the bar to tell SHELLY the news. COOPER smells the contents of his glass.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Cooper, how long ya’ been here?

COOPER
Twelve days sir.

We FOCUS on SHERIFF TRUMAN as he takes a seat next to SHELLY. Facing SHELLY, TRUMAN puts a hand on top of her hands which she has crossed on her knee.

Treating it as good news, SHERIFF TRUMAN smiles.

COOPER and JUDGE STERNWOOD remain seated at the bar. COOPER has still not touched his drink.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
I’ll advise you to keep your eyes on the woods. The woods are wondrous here ... but strange.

We FOCUS on SHELLY as she responds to TRUMAN.

SHELLY
Thanks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pats SHELLY’S hand and leaves. SHELLY, however, isn’t happy with the news and lets out a small sigh.

BIG ED, holding NADINE’S arm, pushes her into the room.

BIG ED
Why don’t you sit down honey. Let me get you a drink.

NADINE
Oh no, I’ll get it.

NADINE walks away with a bounce in her step but before she reaches the kitchen she stops and then quickly turns around. With a frightened expression on her face, NADINE asks ...

NADINE
Where are mom and dad!?

Caught off guard by the question BIG ED nervously looks back to JAMES but quickly answers ...

BIG ED
Ohhhh uhhhhh, out of town.

NADINE
Oh, okay.

NADINE’S smile returns, turns around and hops into the kitchen as she sings ...

NADINE
You’re a jack and I’m a jack. A steeple jack ...

JAMES and BIG ED are now alone in the room.

JAMES
(whispered) Wow!

BIG ED wears a perplexed expression.

BIG ED
Doc Hayward said to roll with the punches.

JAMES
Have you thought about maybe taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?

BIG ED
Nahhh, he’s in Hawaii recovering from that heart attack.

Okay, Cooper hand me the briefcase. I take it.

Using his right hand, JEAN nudges a trigger on his upper left arm that sets off a spring that juts the knife out into a bowl full of fruit. The knife goes right through a strawberry.

BLACKIE
What about Ben Horne?

BLACKIE takes the strawberry off of the knife and slowly eats at it. JEAN wipes the blades of the knife with his fingers and then licks his fingers.

JEAN
Well, he give up control of One-Eyed Jack’s. Its yours.

JEAN reloads the knife into its firing position.

BLACKIE

JEAN stands up.

JEAN
You know, you love a good steak ... but you don’t want to know how it got on to your plate.

JEAN grabs at BLACKIE’S left arm.

JEAN
You must be serious about your business, Blackie.

BLACKIE shrugs him off.

BLACKIE
How are you going to do the girl?

There’s a KNOCK at the door. JEAN waves a hand to a tray filled with a syringe needle, a bent spoon, a knife, a rubber hose and three tiny bags of heroine.

Right, okay. Bye.

ANDY hangs up the telephone.


BACK TO SCENE:

Seated at LUCY’S station, ANDY reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a slip of paper. ANDY dials the telephone.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Laboratory services.

We slowly ZOOM OUT to see that the office, and ANDY included, are covered with small yellow Post-It notes.

ANDY
Yeah, I’m calling for some test results. Doc Hayward said I could just call ya’ up and ...

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Yes, what test was it for sir?

ANDY
What’s it for?

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
It was for a ...

ANDY nervously peers around.

ANDY

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
Sorry, Brennan Andy.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Oh, the doctor’s analysis is Oglio Spermia sir.

ANDY
Yes, could you go slower. I want to write all of this down.

Holding the phone with his left hand, ANDY grabs a pencil and writes on a Post-It note with his right hand.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Oglio Spermia.

ANDY
O-gli-o Sper-mia.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) That’s right.

ANDY

ANDY
Oh alright, thank you.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
Thank you, thank you very much.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Yes.

ANDY hangs up the phone. In the background, SHERIFF TRUMAN walks out from around the corner of the hallway.

ANDY
I’m a whole damn town!

Overhearing ANDY, SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to the open door of the reception office where ANDY is seated.

ANDY
I’m a whole damn town.

Oblivious to what is going on, SHERIFF TRUMAN simply smiles and nods his head. TRUMAN walks off. Elated, ANDY shouts ...

ANDY
Wheewww!

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks into his office and closes the door. AGENT COOPER, sitting at TRUMAN’S desk, turns around and gives him a puzzled look as to what the shout was about.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Don’t ask. Where were we?

On the desk, is a floor plan of One-Eyed Jacks that was drawn by COOPER. The various rooms in the plan are labeled as COOPER points them out.

COOPER
Okay, main bar and greeting room here, casino and get acquainted room.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s this, Blackie’s office?

The door opens and DEPUTY HAWK enters the office holding a small plastic bag.

COOPER
We’ll find out when we get there.

COOPER quickly flips the plan over to hide it from HAWK. SHERIFF TRUMAN moves behind his desk as HAWK moves up to them.

HAWK
The one-armed man is staying at the Robin’s Nest Motel on highway nine. Nobody’s seen him for at least a day - day and a half. The room looks lived in. I found this, same drug as last time.

HAWK open the plastic bag and smells its contents.

HAWK
A weird, deep smell.

HAWK hands the bag over to SHERIFF TRUMAN who opens it and smells its contents.

COOPER
We’re still waiting on Albert’s analysis, good work Hawk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hawk, see ya’ in the morning.

Suspicious of the two, HAWK nods to them and walks toward the door. Before he leaves, HAWK takes one last look into the room. After the door has closed, COOPER flips the plan over and continues to explain his approach to finding AUDREY.

COOPER
Okay, we’ll approach through the woods to the rear door. Inside are stairs leading down to the working rooms.

MUSIC: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

COOPER
My guess is that is where Audrey is being held.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What kinda of muscle do they have?

COOPER
A couple of floor men in the casino probably more in the back.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Let’s go get her.

MUSIC ENDS: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

SHERIFF TRUMAN gets up from his seat behind his desk and grabs his coat and hat. AGENT COOPER rolls up the plan, grabs his coat and walks out of the office. COOPER and TRUMAN pass by ANDY, in the reception office, as they exit out the front door of the building.

COOPER
Good night Andy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
See ya’ in the morning Andy, good work.

ANDY is too occupied to respond to COOPER and TRUMAN as they leave. ANDY looks through all the yellow scraps of Post-It notes he has scattered throughout the office. ANDY lifts a note pad out of the way and finds what he was looking for on a card marked:

ANDY
Gwen and Larry.

ANDY grabs the telephone and dials one of the telephone numbers. ANDY gets a connection.

SECRETARY (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Seattle Abortion Clinic.

HAROLD
Donna Hayward, March 7th, Tuesday, second session.


BACK TO SCENE:

DONNA
Dear diary. (smiles) Uh this is from a long time ago, is that okay?

HAROLD nods his head for yes.

DONNA
I was about thirteen years old, fourteen maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest, shortest skirts - too tight. Laura talked me into it. We were going to the Roadhouse to meet boys. Their names are Josh, Rick and Tim. They’re about twenty years old and they’re nice to us.

DONNA grabs herself a cigarette, lights it up and deeply expels the smoke.

DONNA
And they make us feel like we’re older. Rick asked if we want to go party and Laura says yes and all of a sudden I feel this knot building up in my stomach. But when Laura gets in the truck with Rick I go anyway. Stream in the woods. Full moon I think. Its pale and light out.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

Acting out the scene, DONNA stands up, holds out her arms and slowly twirls around in the middle of the room. HAROLD stops writing and watches her.

DONNA
Laura starts to dance around the boys.

DONNA stops and then moves her hips.

DONNA
She begins to move her hips ... back and forth.

DONNA stops moving her hips and folds her arms to her chest.

DONNA
Rick starts to clap but Tim doesn’t do anything he just watches. Somehow that makes me angry. So I say, ‘lets go skinny dipping’. So we take off our clothes.

DONNA tugs at her top near the neckline. HAROLD stares at her intensely.

DONNA
I know the boys are watching. Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick. I don’t know what to do. So I swim away.

DONNA backs up.

DONNA
I feel like I want to run but I don’t. Tim swims out to me.

DONNA moves forward, holds her left hand up and closes her eyes.

DONNA
He kisses my hand and then me.

DONNA runs her fingers over her lips.

DONNA
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and sweet. My heart jumps. He’s talking to me but I can’t hear him.

DONNA opens her eyes.

DONNA
A hug and a kiss. I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever fell in love.

Tears form in DONNA’S eyes. DONNA sits back down in her chair.

DONNA
That’s all.

HAROLD
That was beautiful Donna.

COOPER becomes a little spooked at the sight of the owl.

We FOCUS on the GUARD at the back door to the building as he continues to smoke his cigarette. The GUARD has no time to react as SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to his right side and grabs his crotch - and grabs tightly. The GUARD freezes, raises his head up and grunts in pain. TRUMAN quickly places a blue rubber ball into his mouth, to gag him, and places some black tape over his mouth. TRUMAN turns him around, grabs him by the back of his hair and slams him head first into the double French doors of the building, which open slightly as the GUARD’S head hits the doors. The GUARD falls back on the ground out cold. COOPER quickly comes out from behind the bushes and helps TRUMAN move the GUARD inside the building.

They pause as two ’52 PICK-UP girls escort a CUSTOMER just past the end of the hall. The walls of the hallway are covered with red drapes and there are small bronze statues on pedestals positioned equidistant and across from each other. COOPER and TRUMAN look around. COOPER unfolds his plan of the building.

COOPER

SHERIFF TRUMAN follows COOPER into another hallway that is wallpapered with a flower design. A doorway draped with red curtains has several GENTLEMEN and WORKING GIRLS inside. A ’52 PICK-UP and CUSTOMER #2 leave the room and enter the hallway. COOPER and TRUMAN turn away so as to not be noticed. The ’52 PICK-UP looks at them but pays them no bother. She and her customer walk down the hall. All clear, COOPER and TRUMAN walk down the hall.

MUSIC ENDS: COUNTRY #2   44K

COOPER and TRUMAN pass a bend in the hallway. COOPER checks his map. As COOPER and TRUMAN pass a closed door they hear a woman gasp. COOPER stops and puts his head near the door to listen if its a woman in trouble. The woman giggles so COOPER and TRUMAN move on. COOPER and TRUMAN come to a fork in the hallway.

COOPER
Wait here Harry.

COOPER walks down one of the hallways as TRUMAN looks around as he waits at the fork of the hallway. COOPER returns.

COOPER
Nah, dead end.

With SHERIFF TRUMAN leading, COOPER and TRUMAN both walk down the other fork of the hallway. As TRUMAN passes another bend in the hallway he turns his head to look into a glass French door. Alerted by people in that room he takes a quick step back and holds out his left arm to warn and stop COOPER. TRUMAN carefully peers into the room.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we look through the veiled glass door and into BLACKIE’S office. With their backs to the door, JEAN and BLACKIE are standing near her desk.

TRUMAN turns to COOPER and holds up two fingers.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

TRUMAN shakes his head for no. COOPER quickly points at his chest and then down the hall - a nonverbal message that he’s going to walk down the hall. TRUMAN nods his understanding. COOPER walks off. TRUMAN stays near the door and returns to looking into BLACKIE’S office.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Again through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we look through the veiled glass door of BLACKIE’S office. To the left of BLACKIE’S desk is a monitor which has the image of AGENT COOPER in his tuxedo, the night he was looking for JACQUES RENAULT.

HAROLD

HAROLD slowly moves to DONNA’S lips and gently kisses her. HAROLD kisses DONNA again with another small touch on the lips. DONNA places a hand on his cheek as they kiss. DONNA’S kiss becomes more passionate but HAROLD starts to back off. DONNA leans forward as she continues to kiss him but HAROLD finally breaks away.

HAROLD

AGENT COOPER walks into the open door of a room. NANCY O’REILLEY quickly walks up to him. COOPER puts on a friendly act as he smiles and moves a hand out to shake hands with NANCY.

COOPER
Hi, would you take me to ...

As NANCY holds her hand out to shake his hand, COOPER quickly grabs her hand, twirls her around and bends her arm behind her back.

COOPER
... Audrey Horne please.

NANCY grimaces in pain. COOPER grabs NANCY’S other arm.

NANCY
Oww, I don’t think she available.

COOPER
Let’s double check.

CUT TO:

INT. AUDREY’S ROOM AT ONE-EYED JACK’S - NIGHT

A door swings open to reveal AGENT COOPER and NANCY. Still holding her arm behind her back, COOPER pushes NANCY into the room. COOPER spots AUDREY HORNE laying on a bed with her hands tied to the bed post. Heavily drugged, AUDREY sleeps.

MUSIC: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 3:24)

COOPER throws NANCY into the room. COOPER walks over to AUDREY. NANCY clings to a tall corner bed post at the foot of the bed. COOPER kneels down close to AUDREY and touches her face.

NANCY
Its not my idea, okay. You’re nothing but meat on a hook to these people.

COOPER quickly turns to NANCY.

COOPER
Shut up.

COOPER returns his attention to AUDREY.

COOPER
Audrey can you hear me?

AUDREY groans and moves slightly. With COOPER preoccupied with AUDREY and being partially concealed by the red drapes on the bed post, NANCY bends down and pulls her knife out of her boot. As NANCY gets her knife, COOPER looks over his shoulder and with the help of a mirror against the wall spots her actions but doesn’t react yet. AUDREY opens her eyes.

AUDREY
My prayers.

COOPER
Oh Audrey, I’m going to take you out of here.

Holding the knife down in the right fist of her hand, NANCY slowly moves from behind the red curtain and over to COOPER. Without even looking back, COOPER reaches out with his left hand and grabs NANCY’S wrist. Still on his knees, he throws her against the wall and punches her in the stomach. NANCY collapses to the floor. COOPER grabs NANCY’S knife and uses it to cut the rope that ties AUDREY to the bedpost. COOPER picks AUDREY up, tosses her over his shoulder and carries her out of the room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through the veiled glass door of SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we scan the room again and can see no one but BLACKIE dead on the floor.


BACK TO SCENE:

All clear, SHERIFF TRUMAN waves to COOPER to proceed. COOPER rushes down the hallway from which they entered. TRUMAN runs right behind COOPER.

MUSIC: A???

As COOPER and TRUMAN enter the hallway with the red drapes that lead to the stairs outside, a man dressed in a tuxedo, GUARD #2, stands waiting for them near the stairs holding a gun pointed at them. SHERIFF TRUMAN has his revolver drawn but not aimed to used so GUARD #2 tells him ...

GUARD #2
Drop the gun, slowly.

COOPER grits his teeth. TRUMAN reluctantly drops his gun on the floor.

GUARD #2
Now turn around.

COOPER and TRUMAN don’t react right away so GUARD #2 cocks his gun. Disappointed, COOPER and TRUMAN turn around.

MUSIC ENDS: A???

With the sound of a SWOOSH an object hits GUARD #2 in the back. GUARD #2 grunts, freezes and then quickly falls forward onto the floor dead to reveal a huge Bowie knife jutting out of his back.

Hearing the sound of GUARD #2 hitting the ground, COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN turn around and are baffled. They look up the stairway to see DEPUTY HAWK, dressed in civilian clothes, walking down the stairs. HAWK stops halfway down the stairs and hunches over.

HAWK
Good thing you guys can’t keep a secret.

AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at each other and smile.

MUSIC: HANK’S THEME   39K

As COOPER and TRUMAN walk up the stairway, HAWK walks down the stairs to retrieve his knife from GUARD #2’S back.




CUT TO:

EXT. ONE-EYED JACK’S - NIGHT

AGENT COOPER, carrying AUDREY, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK run away from the building. We PAN the scene until we FOCUS on HANK, who is standing in the bushes watching them. With his hair blowing in the wind, HANK talks into a cellular telephone.

HANK
There’s been gun fire. Truman and Cooper are leaving with your daughter.

A gun moves up to HANK’S jaw. We PAN LEFT to reveal that JEAN RENAULT holds the gun at HANK’S jaw with his right hand. JEAN’S left hand goes digging through HANK’S black leather coat pocket.

JEAN
Now, who can this be.

JEAN pulls out a wallet, opens it and looks at it.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BADGE

INT. HAROLD SMITH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:35)

Standing in the plant nursery portion of the apartment but looking through the glass window into the next room, DONNA tries to direct MADELEINE to the specific bookshelf by pointing down.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE, standing by the bookcase in the dark, as she looks at DONNA and follows her gesture by bending down to the bottom bookshelf.

Nervously, DONNA peers over her shoulder to see if everything is clear and then quickly returns to directing MADELEINE. Now at the right bookshelf, DONNA gestures and quietly mouths go around for MADELEINE to reach around the corner of the bookcase.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she looks around the corner of the bookcase.

DONNA stares into the dark room as HAROLD walks up behind her and taps her on the back. DONNA nervously jerks around to face HAROLD. DONNA breathes heavily and appears distressed, unaware of what’s going on HAROLD holds up another orchid and asks ...

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   68K

HAROLD
Something wrong?

DONNA
No, you just frightened me that’s all.

We FOCUS on MADEILENE as she finds the peg and tries to turn it. MADEILENE looks back into the plant nursery through the window and sees DONNA occupied with HAROLD.

DONNA tries to think of way to keep HAROLD occupied.

DONNA
Uh, come here. Tell me about this orchid, this one.

DONNA rushes over to a flower away from the window. HAROLD can tell that something is wrong by DONNA’S sudden strange behavior.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she turns the peg that holds the bookshelf in place. MADELEINE pulls the peg out of its hole. Next, MADELEINE pulls the bookshelf forward but its loaded with so many books that the heavy bookshelf falls downward with a loud THUD.

HAROLD hears the loud THUD coming from the next room and looks into the dark main room through the plant nursery window.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:35)

MUSIC ENDS: HAROLD’S THEME   68K

MUSIC: HAROLD’S DARKNESS

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she finds the diary and picks it up. Knowing she has been discovered, MADELEINE stands up and faces the plant nursery window.

Now realizing what was going on, HAROLD, still by the window, lowers his head in disappointment. HAROLD turns around and faces DONNA.

DONNA
Harold no, you don’t understand.

HAROLD turns to his right and walks over to a shelf where he places a flower vase with an orchid he had been holding. HAROLD reaches for a pair of shears but then grabs a hand gardening fork off of the shelf. HAROLD moves to walk into the next room. DONNA sees the gardening fork and rushes to the next room.

DONNA
MADDY!

Two doors allow access into the plant nursery, DONNA exits the door on the left and HAROLD exits the door on the right. DONNA rushes over to MADEILENE and they cling to each other before HAROLD gets there brandishing the hand fork.

DONNA
(shouts) WAIT!

HAROLD backs off slightly.

HAROLD
(shouts) ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SECRETS!

DONNA and MADEILENE shake in fear as they hold each other. HAROLD has tears in his eyes.

HAROLD
(calmly) Is that what all this is about. Well maybe I can help you. Do you know what the ultimate secret is? Do you want to know ... what Laura did?

HAROLD holds the hand fork nears his face and closes his eyes.

HAROLD
The secret of knowing who killed you.

HAROLD drags the hand gardening fork down on his face. Blood seeps from the scratches. MADELEINE screams and buries her head in DONNA’S shoulder.

FADE IN:

1. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

SUDDENLY: HAROLD SMITH looms, gardening tool in hand. It arcs through the air, smashes Laura's diary out of MADDY FERGUSON'S hands. Maddy screams, backs toward the door. But DONNA HAYWARD remains frozen in place, ashen, as Smith turns to her. He speaks quietly at first, almost puzzled. And quite mad.

SMITH
I trusted you. I invested my heart and my soul in you.

DONNA
We only wanted to read it, I didn't -

MADDY
Donna, run!

SMITH
(mounting fury)
I thought you were different. You made me feel I could
return to the world and find something decent and pure.
But you're just like all the others. You lie, you betray, and
then you laugh about it. You are unclean. You have
contaminated me.

Smith raises the tool over his head. Donna remains transfixed. Maddy screams.

MADDY
DONNA!!

Just then: the front door explodes open, JAMES HURLEY tumbles inside. The sound distracts Smith, Donna regains her senses, turns to run. But then she spots Laura's diary open on the floor nearby. Donna moves toward it, as if to grab and flee. Smith yells:

SMITH
(he rushes toward the diary)
NO!

JAMES
Donna!

James rushes forward, Smith raises his hand to strike. Donna retreats, James pushes Smith out of the way, takes Donna by the hand. Maddy joins them as they rush our the door. Smith kneels to retrieve the diary. He looks at the open door, the black night beyond it. The world outside. Smith turns and races back to his greenhouse.

CAMERA VIEWS Smith through the large glass panel, his features lurch into view, shadowy, distorted by the glass. He lets out a howl, but we can't quite hear it behind the thick panes.

Muffled, anguished. It sounds a little like "Laura."

2. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

James, Donna, and Maddy race into the night.

JAMES
Run!!

DONNA
(looking back at house)
He's not coming. He won't. He's afraid.

They stop running, catch breath.

JAMES
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

DONNA
No. I'm fine. I ...

Donna begins to cry. James takes her into his arms. Donna holds him tighter.

DONNA
Oh James. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

JAMES
Don't cry. It's my fault too.
(to Maddy, as if to include)
We have to tell the Sheriff. We'll tell him everything.

DONNA
You've had enough trouble. I'll go.

JAMES
But -

DONNA
Just hold me. Please.

James takes Donna into a deeper embrace. Maddy stands and watches. Then looks away.

4. INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

AGENT COOPER carries AUDREY HORNE into the Bookhouse interior. She moans softly, drifting in and out. DEPUTY HAWK enters behind him. They are met by, a handsome young man. A Bookhouse Boy named CAPPY.

CAPPY
We're all set up inside.

Cooper nods, no time for conversation. He carries Audrey to a bed inside a curtained area. Cappy pulls back a blue blanket, assists Cooper as he gently sets Audrey upon it. They work with quiet, but discernible urgency.

Cooper checks Audrey's pulse, softly placing two fingers upon her neck. He peers into her eyes, listens to whispered breath.

COOPER
Sluggish pulse. Pupils constricted. Breathing slow and shallow.

Cooper gently lifts her left arm - every time he touches her it is with great care and precision and checks inside the elbow. Bruises. Red pinpricks.

COOPER
Needle tracks. Most likely heroin.

HAWK
Poor kid.

AUDREY
(faintly)
Daddy? ... Can you see me Daddy?

COOPER
Multiple injections over the course of a two day period.
Audrey, can you hear me?

Audrey says nothing. Her eyes roll back. She nearly loses consciousness. Cooper leans closer.

COOPER
Audrey, you must stay awake. Do you hear me? You've
got to stay awake.

AUDREY
(airy whisper)
Can you catch me? ... Can you ...?

Cooper watches, helpless, uncertain. Then, urgent, emphatic:

COOPER
I want you to talk to me. Audrey, Please.

There's a faint note of desperation in his voice. But Audrey cannot hear it. She's lost in a heroin fog, she rambles, slips in and out.

AUDREY
His tongue, so heavy ... a hand in my throat ... it hurts me,
Oh God it hurts ...
(she shivers uncontrollably)
Black cold, the lake, black cold ... can't breathe ... help
me, please help me ... I'm sinking ...

Cooper gently gathers Audrey into his arms.

COOPER
I'm here, Audrey. I will stay with you. You're right here.
You're right here with me.

Cooper gently places a hand upon her cheek, offers a healing caress. Suddenly: Audrey's hand rises into view, takes Cooper by the palm. Holds on tight.

COOPER
Audrey?

Audrey's eyes focus. She sees him for the first time.

AUDREY
(weak as a kitten)
I prayed prayed that you would come and you did ...

He holds her.

5. EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Maddy drives off in the station wagon. James and Donna stand together, face to face.

DONNA
She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had
happened to her
(can't continue)

JAMES
No more plans, okay? No more going off on our own.

DONNA
James, he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed
her.

JAMES
He could've killed you too.

Donna offers a gentle kiss, looks deep into James' eyes. A beat, then:

DONNA
I feel stupid. Ashamed.

JAMES
After Laura died, everything happened so fast. It's hard
to know exactly what to believe in.

DONNA
(he's read her mind)
Yes.

JAMES
Bur when I saw you tonight I knew exactly what I
believed.

DONNA
Did you?

JAMES
It's like if we could put our hearts together, and keep
them that way forever, we'd be safe no matter what.

DONNA
You and me.

JAMES
From now on.

DONNA
Yes.

James kisses her on the mouth. Donna reacts with whispered repetition.

DONNA
Yes.

They kiss with even greater fervor. Their passion in direct contrast to - or perhaps in conjunction with - their innocence.

7. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sheriff Truman looks up from a book of mug shots and corresponding paper work as Cooper enters and slumps, exhausted, into a chair across from him.

TRUMAN
How is she?

COOPER
She's through the worst of it. Heroin.
(Truman reacts)
This close to a lethal dose. Sooner or later the dope
would have been lethal. Hard to imagine that kind of
cruelty.

Truman slides the mug book over to Cooper. Points out a shot.

TRUMAN
Not really. Take a look. Blackie's killer. I knew I'd
seen him before. Jean Renault.

COOPER
"Renault?"

TRUMAN
Eldest to Jacques and Bernard. Hell of a lot more
dangerous.
(hand's Cooper a sheet on Renault)
He runs the northern territories. Drugs, extortion,
gambling; you name it.
(putting the pieces together)
There was a tape in Blackie's office of you playing
blackjack the night you and Big Ed visited the casino.

COOPER
(his surmise)
Jean Renault was after me.

TRUMAN
(completing the thought)
The man who caught his brother.

COOPER
(grim)
Renault planned to kill me. And he used Audrey as bait.

It's a deeply troubling revelation. A long beat. Truman comforts, reminds:

TRUMAN
We got her back, Coop. And she's going to be okay.

Cooper doesn't look convinced, a long beat. Then

COOPER
I went out of my jurisdiction twice I've violated my
professional code. And Audrey is paying the price for it.

TRUMAN
We did what we had to do.

COOPER
(beat)
This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering
to someone I care about. In the name of 'doing what I
thought I had to do.' Dammit. I should have known better.

TRUMAN
That doesn't change the fact that Audrey's here now. Not
up at Jack's with a needle in her arm.
(beat)
You're the best lawman I've ever seen, Cooper. But
sometimes you think too much.

He says the latter with admiration and quiet humor. Cooper appreciates both.

COOPER
Thank you, Harry.

HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. Cooper and Truman standing together.

9. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The middle of the night. Deserted, errie. Cooper walks through the empty room carrying a briefcase full of cash.

BEN HORNE enters, finds Cooper waiting for him there. Ben is nervous, but trying hard to hide it. How much does Cooper know?

BEN
Agent Cooper, I got your call.
(spotting briefcase)
What happened? Did you ... ?

COOPER
We were able to free your daughter without payment.

Cooper hands him the briefcase.

BEN
(referring to cash as well as daughter)
Thank God.

COOPER
Audrey was being held in a brothel north of the border
known as One-Eyed Jack's.

BEN
(feigning shock)
No.

COOPER
The brothel's Madam was at least partially responsible
for your daughter's kidnapping and subsequent blackmail.

Ben pauses, fearing what Cooper might know. All the things Blackie could have told him.

BEN
Did you arrest her?

COOPER
She was killed before we could question her.

BEN
(trying to hide his pleasure)
No!

COOPER
Murdered by a man named Jean Renault.

BEN
(as if hearing the name for the first time)
And this Renault, did you catch him?

COOPER
He escaped.

BEN
(more good news)
Too bad.
(opens briefcase, peers at the inside)
Everything seems to be in order.

COOPER
(quietly critical)
Audrey's recovering from a drug overdose.

BEN
(paternal in spite of himself)
Drug overdose? Oh my God.

COOPER
She's going to be all right.

BEN
Can I see her?

COOPER
I wouldn't disturb her now. She's resting, comfortably.
I'll call you in the morning.

Ben doesn't like his tone. But given the time and place, not to mention all the lies he's telling.

BEN
Yes, do that, Agent Cooper. Thank you.

Ben reaches out, takes Cooper into a celebratory hug. It's an odd, awkward gesture. Unexpected. Completely devoid of feeling.

BEN (CONTINUED)
Thank you for bringing my Audrey back to me.

Cooper accepts the embrace. Grudgingly. Then extricates himself, prepatory to leaving

COOPER
Good night, Mr. Horne.

Ben watches, wheels turning, as Cooper steps into the shadows.

10. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOME DAY

BOBBY BRIGGS, in sport coat and tie, struggles to push LEO JOHNSON in his wheelchair through the doorway. It's too tight a fit. Bobby curses under his breath, struggles with the chair. Maybe he can slide it through sideways.

SHELLY JOHNSON and an Insurance Representative, TOM BROCKMAN, watch Leo's bumpy progress from the living room. Shelly winces with each shove and bang. Brockman, fifties, unctuous, offers his best sympathy:

BROCKMAN
Poor fellow, really gone.

BOBBY
(muttered)
You ain't kiddin'.

Bobby finally gets Leo into the living room nearly losing control of the chair, but holds on tight, manages a grim smile for Brockman. The Insurance Agent returns it.

BROCKMAN
I want you to know how much I admire you kids,
standing by Mr. Johnson. Not taking the easy way out.
Most people would just ship him off.

BOBBY
(as close to piety as he can manage)
Yeah, well, Leo's sorta special to us.

BROCKMAN
Believe you me, in-home care is the stuff of miracles. It
may not always seem that way to you, but Mr. Johnson
should benefit tremendously from his being here among
his loved ones.

SHELLY
(working, a smile into place)
We certainly hope so.

BROCKMAN
(while inspecting bed and winch)
Will you be hiring full or part-time help?

SHELLY
Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time.

BROCKMAN
I admire your dedication.
(concluding, reaching into briefcase)
Everything looks to be in order. You might want to child-
proof those electrical sockets when you get a chance. Sign
here ...

Brockman extracts a form from his briefcase. Shelly signs it.

BROCKMAN
(returns form to briefcase, hands Shelly envelope)
Your check

Shelly opens it, reacts with disbelief.

SHELLY
There must be some mistake.

Bobby takes the check Looks at it. He can't believe it either.

BOBBY
1700 bucks?

BROCKMAN
(with a sympathetic nod)
Sad, isn't it? The cost of health care is going through the
roof.

BOBBY
It's bringing rain. We're supposed to get five thousand a
month.

BROCKMAN
Figure state and local taxes, equipment fees, medical and
maintinence costs, administrative fees ... you see the
results. Fortunately with you two here Mr. Johnson will
be more than adequately provided for. Good luck

Brockman extends a hand for shaking. Bobby just looks at him for beat, a little dazed. Then he offers an aimless handclasp. Brockman exits. Shelly turns to Bobby, mortified.

SHELLY
I have to quit my job, Bobby. How am I going to make
it on this?

BOBBY
I don't know.

SHELLY
You don't know? Bringing him home was your bright idea
in the first place -

BOBBY
I'm thinking.

Shelly stops, swallows hard. Fights a few unwanted tears.

SHELLY
Well you'd better think of somethin'. For both of us.

Just then: a quiet noise from Leo's chair. From Leo. It starts somewhere deep his chest, then pours weakly out his lips. A moan. A protest. Bobby and Shelly both whirl about, stare at Leo with amazement. His face remains blank. His eyes deeply empty. But the sound continues, now stutters just a bit. HOLD ON Leo for a beat.

11. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Donna sits before a doubting Sheriff Truman in the Interrogation Room.

TRUMAN
Donna. We, already have Laura Palmer's diary.

DONNA
No, this is her secret diary.

TRUMAN
(dubious)
And she gave it to this "Harold Smith?" Why?

DONNA
I don't know. To hide it or something.

TRUMAN
Did he ever actually show you the diary?

DONNA
No. But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside
cover. Her handwriting.

TRUMAN
Donna, are you and James up to something again, He's
been warned about getting mixed up -

DONNA
(she can't tell him the whole story)
James has nothing to do with this.

TRUMAN
(doesn't believe her)
I'm sorry, it's a little bit like the boy who cried wolf.
The last time you played this game Dr. Jacoby ended up
in a hospital bed.

DONNA
It's not a game.

TRUMAN
(responding to her sincerity)
All right. I'll try to get someone out there to take a look.
We've got our hands full, I can't promise anything -

DONNA
Sheriff, please -

Suddenly: a loud man stands in the doorway, interrupts. His name is GORDON COLE.

COLE
EXCUSE ME! I'M LOOKING FOR A SHERIFF
TRUMAN.

TRUMAN
That's me.

Cole enters, extends a hand. He's in his forties and wears a pink hearing aid in each ear.

COLE
FBI REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF, GORDON
COLE. THAT'S A REAL MOUTHFUL AND I
CAN'T HEAR MYSELF ANYWAY. I'M AGENT
COOPER'S SUPERVISOR.

GONE. LONG STORY. GOT THESE THINGS
CRANKED UP TO THE MAX.

TRUMAN
Are you looking for Agent Cooper?

WHEN AN AGENT GOES DOWN IN THE FIELD
I JUMP RIGHT UP AND PAY A VISIT.

TRUMAN
Agent Cooper isn't here right now.

COLE
ALBERT ROSENFIELD IS NOT COMING BACK,
BUT I'VE GOT HIS WORK RIGHT HERE.

Truman reacts to Cole's errant conversational rhythms. Cole opens his satchel, refers to notes.

COLE
ITEM: A VICUNA COAT: FIBERS ALBERT
FOUND IN THE HALL OUTSIDE COOPER'S
ROOM ARE FROM A VICUNA COAT.

TRUMAN
The coat was vicuna?

COLE
NO THANKS. I ALREADY ATE. GOT THE LAB
REPORT FROM ALBERT ON THE ONE
ARMER'S SYRINGE. SAYS HE'S NEVER SEEN A
DRUG LIKE IT. A COMBO: REALLY WIERD
STUFF.

Donna watches their exchange, impatient, ignored for the moment.

TRUMAN
Did Albert say anything else?

COLE
PAPERS FOUND NEAR THE BLOODY TOWEL
DOWN THE TRAIN TRACKS FROM THE
CRIME SITE. FROM A DIARY.

Just then: around the corner, another interruption. DEPUTY HAWK leads an angry PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD, the one-armed salesman, towards lock-up.

MIKE
Since when is selling shoes against the law?

COLE
THERE'S THE ONE-ARMER NOW.

TRUMAN
We need to ask you a few questions, Mr. Gerard. Why
don't we all move to my office?

Truman leads them away. Donna comes out of interrogation. HOLD ON Donna for a beat. She sighs, watches them go. She's got no one to tell her story to.

12. INT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY

START CLOSE on Audrey, asleep, peaceful. Ben Horne's voice is heard:

BEN'S VOICE
She looks like an angel.

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Agent Cooper and Ben Horne standing over her. Cooper says nothing, just looks at Audrey. Then he kneels to wake her.

COOPER
Audrey? You're father is here.

Audrey's eyes flutter open. She's weak, dreamy. Ben comes around from behind Cooper, crouches at her side.

BEN
Thank god, Audrey. Thank god.

Ben tries to embrace her. But Audrey focuses, realizes who it is. And recoils. Cooper takes notice. Ben shifts backward, plays the loving father without missing a beat.

BEN
I was so worried about you.

AUDREY
Were you?

BEN
(ignoring her tone of voice)
Worried sick. Times like these make a man aware of the
value of life. Every raindrop. Every sunset.

AUDREY
(pointedly)
I'm aware of a lot of new things too.

BEN
(shushes her)
Don't talk now, sweetheart. We're going to get you
home. Safe and warm. In your own bed. God, what a
terrible experience. What terrible people. The things
you must have seen.

AUDREY
(she knows he knows)
I saw so much.

Ben tenses, checks to see if Cooper is listening. He is.

BEN
(wanting to sum it all up)
We'll sort it out. Together.

AUDREY
(a threat)
Yes. You and I, Daddy.

BEN
That's my girl.
(rises, happy to bring this duel to a conclusion; to
Cooper)
My car's outside. I'll take her home now.

AUDREY
Daddy?

Ben turns back to Audrey. Her tone of voice.

BEN
(what now?)
Yes, darling.

AUDREY
I'd like Agent Cooper to take me home. If that's okay
with you.

BEN
(flustered, but hiding it well)
Yes. That's Fine. Or ...
(With a cautious look at Cooper)
... we could all go together.

Cooper nods. Wonders what Ben is hiding. And what it is that Audrey knows.

13. INT. ED HURLEY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

NADINE HURLEY enters, carrying some boxes from Horne's.

NADINE
Ed, I'm home!

Ed comes out of the kitchen to see her, wearing a teenager's JUMPER DRESS. She plops down a bundle of packages, labeled, "HORNE'S JUNIOR MISS DEPARTMENT."

NADINE (CONTINUED)
Isn't this the swellest dress you've ever seen? And you
know, they didn't look at me twice when I used the
credit card - say, Ed, when do my folks get back from
Europe, anyway?

ED
(stoically playing along)
Pretty soon.

NADINE
(sultry)
It's neat having the house all to ourselves. Pretend it's
ours. Like we were married or something

ED
We can do that.

NADINE
(with a wink)
I know some or-her stuff we can do.

ED
Like what?

NADINE
You know, silly.
(punches him playfully. It hurts)
You know what I was I thinkin'? Tonight maybe we could
go park by the lake and neck.

ED
Maybe.

NADINE
(beaming ecstatically)
Wait a minute. We don't have to go anywhere. Why we
can stay ... right ... here.

Nadine pulls Ed into a deep kiss. Her incredible new strength, her incredible new sex drive. It's all a little dodgy for Big, Ed. A beat. Nadine pulls back, suddenly concerned. Reality keep whispering past her delerium.

NADINE
When are your parents coming home?

Poor, poor Ed.
CUT TO:


14. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE LIBRARY - DAY

START CLOSE on JOSIE PACKARD, lying upon a sofa. Her clothing in disarray, tear tracks on her cheeks. She sits up, unsteady, as if she had been assaulted.

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals JONATHAN, the Asian Man, standing over her. He buckles his belt, adjusts his shirt, looks at her coldly. Boxes are strewn about the floor at his feet; Josie's shopping purchases, now scattered. Jonathan kneels, paws through the baubles and wrapping paper as one might the spoils of a war recently won.

JONATHAN
You've kept yourself in fine nick, Josie. Sapphire earrings
... Parisian perfume ... cashmere sweaters, silk blouses.

JOSIE
(quiet and afraid)
Please go.

He reaches into his jacket pocket, produces an envelope, tosses it to Josie. Josie flinches, the envelope falls to the floor.

JONATHAN
A one-way ticket. Seattle, Hong Kong

JOSIE
I have one more day.

JONATHAN
Keep what you earn. That was the deal.
(with a look at the purchases)
See how much you can fit into your suitcases. We leave
tonight.

JOSIE
(afraid to look at him)
Ben Horne hasn't payed me yet; I've been waiting five
years -

JONATHAN
Mr. Eckhardt will make it more than worth your while.

JOSIE
You can't make me leave -

Suddenly: Jonathan grabs Josie behind the neck, pulls her forward. Josie shudders, is afraid to resist. Jonathan offers a cold, hurtful kiss. Then he whispers.

JONATHAN
Be adaptable.

JOSIE
(pleading through her fear)
We had an arrangement ...

Jonathan releases her, now turns his grip into a caress, his fingers tracing her jawbone.

JONATHAN
Sheriff Truman is important to you. You be to him. You
make him into a fool. But he is important to you
nonetheless,
(her silence gives him the answer he needs)
Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him.

JOSIE
He doesn't know anything -

Jonathan's fingers move smoothly from jawbone to lips, silence her. It is a gesture both violent and sexual.

JONATHAN
The plane leaves at midnight. Be there. Or I will come
for you. And your Sheriff. That's ... the arrangement.

HOLD ON them for a beat.

15. EXT. LAKE - DAY

James pulls up on his bike, approaches Maddy waiting, by the water. Both a little sad. Both wiser.

JAMES
I think I owe you an apology.

MADDY
Not really.

JAMES
When we were to together you know, just talking ... I felt
something. I just wasn't sure.

MADDY
(completes his thought)
You looked at me and you saw Laura.

JAMES
I guess I did.

MADDY
Want to know somethin' strange? I liked it.

JAMES
You did?

MADDY
When we were growing up, Laura and I were so close it
was scary. I could feel her thoughts. Like our brains were
connected or something. Our mothers were the same way.
(beat)
When she died suddenly I had a chance to be Laura. At
least other people saw me that way. Like the way you
looked at me. I liked that too.

JAMES
It was wrong.

MADDY
It wasn't one thing or the other. For a while I got to be
somebody different. Now I'm just me again.

James pauses, uncertain. Maddy continues, reassures:

MADDY
You and Donna belong together. That's the best thing.

JAMES
(agreeing, confessing)
It's hard sometimes, you know?

MADDY
(simple/direct)
How?

JAMES
If you really love someone, it's like this bright light is
shining on you every minute. You're right in it. It's great.
But I don't think you can stay that way all the time.

MADDY
Sure you can.

JAMES
(looks at her, beat)
I want to. I want to try to make the way my heart feels
last forever. Pretty weird.

Maddy doesn't think it's weird at all. A tender beat. Just a whisper of what might have been between them. Then Maddy offers a confession of her own:

MADDY
I'm going home tomorrow, James. I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeral. And I stayed for Uncle Leland and
Aunt Sarah, just to help out. But it's time to go ...

JAMES
So this is goodbye or somethin' ...

MADDY
I guess it is.
(with gentle humor)
Bye, James.

She gives him a sweet kiss. He smiles. They separate.

16. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY (SUNDOWN)

Ben Horne is pouring two glasses of wine. He hands one glass to someone who is revealed to be Josie.

BEN
Jerry brought back a case from some obscure French
vineyard. I've been saving it for just such a special
occasion as this.
(proposes a toast)
To "The Fire."

Horne takes a sip, then steps behind his desk, sits. A more business-like mien.

BEN (CONTINUED)
Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?

JOSIE
I've got the contract with Pete's Signature. I want my
money.

BEN
Of course you do.

JOSIE
All of it. Now. Before you get this.

BEN
Josie, Josie. Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own can
grasp the complicated position we're in. Fluidity is all.
I can't summon up cash reserves I don't have. But I have
already and will be happy to assure you again that as the
contracted payments arrive from Iceland your percentage
will immediately -

JOSIE
(hot)
I won't leave this office without my money

Pause.

BEN
Why do I sense this isn't a negotiable position? You're
under some kind of pressure, aren't you?

JOSIE
(a cold warning)
Do not ... play games with me.

BEN
Games?

Ben smiles, reaches into a drawer, removes a small gold key. He holds it up for Josie to see.

BEN
This key unlocks my personal hotel safe. And inside that
safe, I've put together a fascinating dossier on you, dear
Josie, and husband Andrew's little boat that went boom.
(beat, cold)
So you behave yourself, lady, or, believe me when I say
this ... I will ... bury you.

Josie moves towards him. Shows him a key.

JOSIE
That's a shame. Because if anything unfortunate were to
happen to me, it would lead authorities to a certain safety
deposit box in another city. Inside of which is
enough evident to put you away for three lifetimes.
They'll bury us side by side.

They stare at each other; mongoose and cobra.

BEN
Stalemate.

Now Josie moves towards Ben seductively, holding the contract.

JOSIE
Your move. Cash.

BEN
(pause; an idea)
Happily, I can accomodate you.

He goes back to his desk, retrieves TOJAMURA'S CASHIER'S CHECK and endorses it.

BEN
A sign of my good faith. Tokyo bank. Five million
dollars.

Ben hands the check to Josie. She examines it. Folds it. Puts it away. Hands him the contract.

JOSIE
We're finished.

BEN
(admiringly)
Well played, Josie.

Ben finishes his wine. She leaves.

17. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Establish. And, oddly, the sound of MUSIC from within. Kazoos.
CUT TO:


18. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

START CLOSE on Leo Johnson. Wheelchair bound, he wears a festive party hat, Ray Ban shades, and a blank expression. A kazoo hangs from his mouth, it bleats with each jagged breath. But Leo remains perfectly still. On permanent leave in the Land of Nod.

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Bobby and Shelly. Wearing party hats, piping a jaunty tune on their own kazoos, Auld Lang Syne. Shelly leads Leo to the dinner table, a cake before him. Bobby acts the mocking Master of Ceremonies.

BOBBY
Leo, we figured with you gettin' out and all, well, what
the hell, we sorta wanted to give you a little party. Our
way of saying, hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home.

SHELLY
(mock dutiful)
Welcome home, darling.

Bobby paces, steps behind Leo. Adjusts his glasses. Tweaks his nose.

BOBBY
Cause you're a special guy, Leo. And we just want you to
know that we remember all the great stuff you did for the
ones you loved.

Bobby pulls up Leo's hat, the elastic chin strap stretches, then Bobby lets it snap back down.

BOBBY
Like Shelly here. Who could ask for a more caring and
thoughtful husband? Makin' her clean your dirty clothes.
Wash your dishes. Mop your floors. You're a class act,
man. Top to bottom.
(kneels, speaks right past his ear)
And how 'bout Leo Johnson, wife abuser? There's a guy
you want to party with. Soap in a sock. Internal injuries
and barely leaves a bruise.
(rises, resumes pacing)
But last, and I'm thinkin' not least, we got Leo Johnson,
murderer. Hang your wife up like a piece of meat.
Leave her to burn. Don't let anybody ever tell ya you
don't know how to treat a woman.

Bobby puts his arms around Shelly. Gives her a deep kiss. Both turn to look at Leo in his chair, festively decorated, utterly silent.

BOBBY
(the familiar intonation)
"This is your life," Leo Johnson. You deserve it. Every
damn minute.

Bobby kisses her again, gently pushes her backward, onto the table. Takes one last look at Leo.

BOBBY
Sorta makes you believe in karma, don't it?

Bobby kisses her more passionately, she returns his kisses with equal fervor. He pulls at her blouse, she hurries to unbutton his shirt. But then, she can't help it, Shelly turns to glance at Leo.

Leo remains inert. But the angle, Shelly's guilty conscience, perhaps a flare of light off the Ray Bans, all conspire to suggest movement, some imperceptible shift in Leo's posture.

Shelly SCREAMS. Rolls out from under Bobby.

BOBBY
What? What?

SHELLY
He moved. I saw him move.
(he reaches or he she pulls away)
No. It's too creepy. It's wrong, Bobby.

Bobby looks from Shelly to Leo. Walks to him.

BOBBY
Okay, Shel. Maybe you're right. I mean I don't wanna
exploit him or nothing.

Bobby carefully removes the party hat, the shades. And the kazoo from Leo's mouth.

BOBBY
Sorry, Leo. We sorta lost control. No need to make
your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
Doc Hayward says you need 'familiar stimulus', so we
just figured, what the hell ... kazoos.

Bobby scoots Leo a little closer to the dinner table, the cake before him, continues, soothes:

BOBBY
Honest, Leo, Shelly and me are gonna do everything we
can to keep you safe and happy.
(new idea)
You want some cake or somethin'? That'd be nice, huh?
With ice cream?

Bobby spoons a big scoop onto the cake as he speaks. Leo does a header into the cake and cream. Shelly gasps.

SHELLY
Bobby!

Bobby pulls Leo's face out of the cake, returns him to a sitting position. Turns to Shelly.

BOBBY
Gee, you gotta be more careful, Leo. Good thing we
didn't light the candles.

A beat. Then, she can't help it... Shelly begins to laugh.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

Gordon Cole sits on a bench in the station foyer. He glances at his watch. Adjusts his hearing aids, as if to balance the volume from left to right. Cooper and Truman enter.

COLE
AGENT DALE COOPER!

COOPER
Hello, Gordon. Hope you haven't been waiting too long.

COLE
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE YOU HERE FOR
THE BETTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON.

COOPER
What can I do for you?

COLE
NO MATTER WHATSOEVER. NO APOLOGY
NECESSARY. GOT TO MEET THE LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT TEAM. A GREAT BUNCH.
(YOU REMIND ME OF A LITTLE MEXICAN
CHIHUAHUA TODAY)

Truman nods thanks. Cole continues, as sotto voce as he can manage:

COLE
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?

COOPER
Of course. Harry, may we use your office?

TRUMAN
Go right ahead.

COLE
HOW ABOUT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE?

Cooper leads Gordon Cole inside.

Truman and Hawk stand in the hall. They can, of course, hear every booming word.

COOPER
Gordon, Albert's wrong.

COLE
YOU WENT INTO THE CHUTE IN
PITTSBURGH, COOP. I WANT TO MAKE
DOUBLY SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
AGAIN. COPY?

COOPER
Pittsburgh was a completely different story.

Cole stares at Cooper, obviously having missed what Cooper said. Cooper repeats, this time with appropriate volume.

COOPER
I WAS WOUNDED IN PITTSBURGH BUT
OTHER THAN THAT THE CASE BEARS NO
SIMILARITIES.

COLE
I MUST SAY YOU LOOK ALL RIGHT. CIRCLES
UNDER YOUR EYES, YOU COULD CATCH UP
ON YOUR SLEEP, BUT THAT PRETTY MUCH
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

Cooper holds up a hand to stop the verbal torrent. Cole stops, unfazed. Now completely focused on his subordinate.

COOPER
GORDON, I AM TIRED. THERE IS A GREAT
DEAL OF WORK TO DO. BUT MY MIND, BODY,
AND SPIRIT ARE UP TO THE TASK.
WITHOUT A DOUBT. EVERYTHING IS A-
OKAY.

Cole gives Cooper a hearty thumbs up. Cooper responds in kind. Cole withdraws an envelope from his jacket pocket. Truman enters.

TRUMAN
Coop, just thought you ought to know we can hear
everything you're saying out there.

COOPER
Thanks, Harry.

COLE
(re envelope)
ANONYMOUS MESSAGE. SENT TO HOME
BASE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, COOP.
LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR, DOESN'T IT?

Cooper opens the envelope. A small piece of paper falls into view. Cooper examines it. It reads: P to K-4. Cole studies it over Cooper's shoulder.

COLE
IT'S A CHESS DEAL.

COOPER
An opening move. From Windom Earle.

Ben Horne paces while LELAND PALMER sits like a puppy watching him.

BEN
I can't be too specific, Leland, but with Jerry on the road
I need you back here. Let's just say I have a much better
sense of what you've been through in the last few weeks.

LELAND
I appreciate that, Ben. And I appreciate the confidence.
Really I do.

BEN
If it weren't for your indictment, I could drop you into
your old slot. Our friendship, our history together. But
first I need to know you're okay.

LELAND
I am 100%. 110%. Let me prove it to you.

BEN
(jumping right in)
We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on
Ghostwood, but a group from the Orient wants in in the
worst way. Jerry's on his way to Tokyo to check them
out. I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner. We need to
buy a little time here.

LELAND
First thing we do is re-survey the land. Required because
of the fire. Set up a parade of inspectors, federal, state,
and county 'til Jerry comes back with a full report. If
there is money coming from either direction, we run it
thru the Caymans, pick up some pocket money on the
exchange rate. And if we have to we can drop escrow
into a black hole for six months.

BEN
(beaming)
That's my Leland.

The phone RINGS, Ben answers it. Tojomura is waiting for him in the hotel bar. While Ben is occupied, Leland slips over to the bookshelf, a stuffed white fox displayed there. Leland surreptitiously removes a clump of hair from the stuffed animal, secrets it in his coat pocket.

24. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

Truman hurries into the room, nearly bumps into Jonathan, the Asian man who is loaded down with Josie's luggage. Josie comes out the door from the office, carries luggage as well. Truman tries to read what is happening off of Josie's face.

TRUMAN
Josie?

JOSIE
Harry, I don't believe you have met my assistant, Mr.
Lee.

JONATHAN
(Asian accent)
Pleased to meet you.
(to Josie)
I'll take these to car.

He nods to Truman and exits with the luggage.

TRUMAN
What are you doing?

JOSIE
I'm going away.

Pause. She moves away from him.

TRUMAN
Where? Why?

JOSIE
I always called you from here. It was here I could talk to
you and be everything you wanted me to be.

TRUMAN
(more firmly)
Where are you going?

JOSIE
I sold the mill. It's over. I'm going home.

TRUMAN
No.

Truman grabs Josie, kisses her. She almost loses herself, then pulls away.

JOSIE
I'm sorry, Don't think badly of me.

Jonathan appears in the doorway.

TRUMAN
You can't leave.

JOSIE
Are you speaking as the police?

TRUMAN
I ... I don't know.

JOSIE
It would be best if you ... forget about me.

Josie picks up her bag. Starts to follows Lee out the door.

TRUMAN
I love you.

Josie stops. Truman is down to nothing.

TRUMAN (CONTINUED)

26. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOUNGE NIGHT

Ben Horne and Tojamura take a seat in the lounge after dinner.

BEN
Mr. Tojamura, how about a nitecap?

TOJAMURA
Soda water, please.
(turns to him)
Mr. Horne, allow me to be artless. You have my cashiers
check for five million. I have nothing. Why?

BEN
I know so little about you, Mr. Tojamura and this is a
small community. I'm being careful. Trying to be
sensitive to local concerns. You have to understand the
impact this project will have on the community

TOJOMURA
You waste my time. We shall withdraw.

BEN
(backing and filling)
Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojomura. Consider the position
I'm in. The mill fire has created a raft of unforeseen
problems, psychic as well as financial. It is my duty as
a civic leader to foster the healing process, even at the
temporary expense of my larger business opportunities.
But I assure you -

TOJOMURA
(curt)
I know a little about fire. My family was at Nagasaki.

BEN
(without a trace of true feeling)
And what a tragedy it was. Horrifying.

From across the room, loud piano playing stops their conversation. They hear a singer.

LELAND'S VOICE
"I'm wild again. Beguiled again. A simpering,
whimpering child again. Bewitched, bothered, and
bewildered, Am I."

Ben spots Leland across the lounge, singing to TRUDY'S accompaniment.

BEN
Excuse me a moment.

LELAND
(etc.)
"Lost my heart, but what of it..."

Leland moves through the bewildered guests, holding his mic. He stops at a table with an ELDERLY COUPLE.

LELAND
And where might you folks be from? Twin Peaks? Hey,
that's great, and how about those Steeplejacks, huh?

Leland finishes the song. Police applause.

LELAND
Thank you. Great Northern audiences are the greatest
audiences in the world.

Ben puts a hand on Leland's shoulder and guides him behind the piano.

BEN
Give it a rest, Leland.
(covers the mic)
Temporary insanity, eh, Leland? Let's hope some of
your jury's out there, you're home free.

Tojomura sits at the bar watching. Finds himself sitting next to PETE MARTELL. Pete smiles at him.

PETE
(re song, with a nod toward Leland)
"Pal Joey." You like musicals?

TOJOMURA
No.

PETE
Not even "Fiddler On the Roof?" Always makes me
weep like a baby.

TOJOMURA
I find the adherence to fantasy troubling and
unreasonable.

PETE
(pondering for an instant)
Yeah, well ...
(clinging to his own oddball beliefs)
Fiddler is something special.
(beat)
You're not from around here, are you?

TOJOMURA
I am a visitor.

PETE
Can I buy you a sake?

TOJOMURA
No thank you.

PETE

How about a nice cold milk?

Tojomura frowns. Ecch.

27. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Mike the One-Armed Man sits in a chair, swears and fidgets. Cooper, Truman, Gordon Cole, and Hawk stand about him.

MIKE
Please give me my medicine. I can feel the change.

TRUMAN
What change?

COOPER
The drug in your possession contains trace elements
usually found in Haloperidol. Do you suffer from
schizophrenia? Multiple personalities?

MIKE
It's too late ...

Cooper shows Mike the flyer picture of the Long-Haired Man.

COOPER
You know this man, don't you? Why did you lie to me
the first time I questioned you?

MIKE
It wasn't me. Don't you understand? It wasn't me?!!

Mike looks dreadful. Cooper turns to Truman.

COOPER
Give him the drug.

TRUMAN
But ...

COOPER
Now.

Cooper turns back to Mike. Reacts. Truman and Hawk SEE what he sees. They freeze. And Mike the One-Armed Man begins a TRANSFORMATION. Mike fights it at first, he arches in his chair as if to fend off some invading spirit. But then his body relaxes completely, his arms fall to the side. Mike's features shift, a shadow passes into his eyes. His head, once bowed, now raises up; he looks Cooper squarely in the eyes.

MIKE
There is no need for medicine. I am not in pain.

COOPER
Who are you?

MIKE
My name is Mike.

COOPER
What are you?

MIKE
I am an inhabiting spirit.

COOPER
Who is Phillip Gerard?

MIKE
He is host to me.

COOPER
You spoke to me in my dream. Do you remember?
(a neutral response)
Do you know "Bob?"

MIKE
He ... was my familiar.

COOPER
(after a beat)
Where does Bob come from?

MIKE
There are indications that we come from another world.

Truman and Hawk exchange a glance. They don't believe a word.

COOPER
What does Bob want?

MIKE
He is Bob, eager for fun. He wears a smile, everybody
run.
(smiles)
Do you understand the parasite? It attaches itself to a life
form and feeds. Bob requires a human host. He feeds on
fear and life force. I am like Bob. I was once his partner.

COOPER
(quoting his dream)
"Through the darkness of future past the magician longs
to see ..."

MIKE
(he completes it)
"... one chants out between two worlds, fire, walk with
me ..."
(beat)
But then I saw the Face of God and was purified. I cut
off my arm. And remained close to this vessel.
Inhabiting from time to time for a single purpose.

COOPER
To find Bob.

MIKE
To stop him.
(points to the flyer in Cooper's hand)
This is his true face. Few can see it. The gifted and the
damned.

COOPER
Is he near? Is Bob near us now?

MIKE
For nearly forty years.

COOPER
Where?

MIKE
A large house made of wood. Surrounded by trees. The
house is filled with many rooms, each alike. But they are
occupied by different souls. Night after night.

Truman and Hawk have no idea what the man is talking about. Cooper does.

COOPER
The Great Northern Hotel.

TRUMAN
Full cooperation. Hawk you've got the warrant for

HAWK

TRUMAN'S VOICE
Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith, it's the police, open the door ...
Mr. Smith, we have a warrant to search your apartment ...

The doorknob turns. The door swings open; a beat, then TRUMAN, COOPER and HAWK pour into the room, weapons drawn. The room has been ravaged. Smith's diaries, torn and tattered lie in a pile of paper in the middle of the room. CAMERA follows Truman and Cooper across the room and up to the window looking in the greenhouse ... where we see Smith's legs suspended swinging He's hung himself. Cooper and Truman look at each other. There's a note taped to the window. Cooper reads it:

COOPER
"Je suis une ame solitaire."
(translating)
I am a lonely soul.

3. INT. SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

FORENSIC field men at work , sifting through the pile of torn and savaged papers in the center of the room. One examines the window looking into the second room. Truman supervises. TWO PARAMEDICS wheel out a gurney; Harold Smith's remains, bagged.

Cooper enters leading a haggard looking PHIL GERARD, the one-armed man, still in his "Mike" stare. Cooper raises a hand, stops the gurney, gestures to Gerard. Gerard puts his hand on the bag, closes his eyes. The working cops stop and stare.

COOPER
Was he here?

GERARD
(pause, opens his eyes)
Bob never lingers after death.

COOPER
Was he here?

GERARD
(sahakes his head)
Bob has not visited here.

Truman rolls his eyes. Cooper nods to the Paramedics; they wheel Smith out. Gerard, unsteady on his feet, seeks refuge in a chair. Truman takes Cooper quietly aside.

TRUMAN
Think this is a good idea, in front of the men and all?

COOPER
Harry, we're at the chicken-soup stage of this crime.

TRUMAN
How's that?

COOPER
"It couldn't hurt."
(a blank look)
That's something people say back in Philadelphia.

Truman produces Smith's wallet.

TRUMAN
We're trying to get ahold of Jacoby in Hawaii; Smith
was a patient.

COOPER
Was the agoraphobia for real. Did he ever go outside.

TRUMAN
He was a class "A" nutball, that much seems clear.

COOPER
Blood type?

TRUMAN
We'll have it soon.
(a glance back at Gerard)
Wouldn't hurt for Jacoby to get a gander at this guy
either.
(a second glance)
Looks a little green around the gills.

COOPER
It's not easy being "Mike."
(nods, moves to him)
Would you like some coffee, "Mike"?

Gerard shakes his head. Hawk unearths something from the large paper scrap pile, moves with it to Cooper.

Cooper accepts the damaged object, opens it: ... this is the diary of Laura Palmer ...

Morning, dear.

LELAND
Morning, Maddy.

MADDY
Uncle Leland, Aunt Sarah ...

SARAH
What is it, dear?

LELAND
Would you like some coffee?

Maddy shakes her head, sits beside them.

SARAH
Did you sleep well?

MADDY
Very well, thanks.

Sarah pats her hand. Leland and Sarah go back to their paper.

MADDY (CONTINUED)
I've been thinking. I've really enjoyed my stay and
everything, but I really feel like it's time to go home.

Sarah and Leland lower their papers.

MADDY (CONTINUED)
To Missoula. I've got my job and my apartment and I

Of course, dear.

We'll miss you, naturally, but we understand

You've been a wonderful help.

LELAND
You'll come back to visit, won't you?

Of course.

SHELLY
(totaling up)
... so we've got bills here that total ... one thousand and
fourteen dollars ...

BOBBY
(with the checkbook)
Including the insurance money, that'll leave you with ...

SHELLY
Forty-two dollars. Forty-two dollars.

BOBBY
That's a start.

SHELLY
Forty-two dollars for the month? Bobby, how am I
gonna do that? How are we gonna live on 42 dollars a
month?

BOBBY
We?

SHELLY
Me and Leo.
(pause)
Bobby, you said you were gonna take care of -

BOBBY
I am. I am, Shelly.
(rises, thinks)

SHELLY
I want you to take the necklace back -

BOBBY
We don't have to do that -

Shelly retrieves the box from her hiding place.

SHELLY
I want you to take it back, we need the money -

BOBBY
Shelly, you're gonna keep that necklace -

SHELLY
When am I ever gonna feel glamorous enough to wear it?
Giving Leo a bath? Feeding him his oatmeal?

BOBBY
What about his truck? He's not gonna be cannonballing
down the highway any time soon, it must be worth a -

SHELLY
The police impounded it -

BOBBY
We'll get it back -

SHELLY
They said if it was used in the commission of a crime it
becomes property of the state -

BOBBY
But they haven't charged him with anything -

SHELLY
(a shrill note)
I didn't make the rules!

BOBBY
Okay, okay -

SHELLY
It's like you're blaming me for something -

BOBBY
I'm not blaming you. Take it easy.
(back to Leo)
Leo was into a lot of stuff and he was in it for the money.

SHELLY
He must've had partners. We could ask them.

BOBBY
(a look)
Not a good idea.

SHELLY
But so you think Leo had money?

BOBBY
Yes. And from the look of that checkbook he never saw
the inside of a bank. He had hiding places.

Snaps his fingers in front of Leo's face.

BOBBY (CONTINUED)
Leo, you in there? Hey, Leo ...
(articularing carefully)
where did you put the money? M-o-n-e-y -

LEO
(probably not in response)
Leo needs new shooooes ...

BOBBY
Maybe a pair of house slippers, pal. And they'll
probably last you a few decades.

LEO
New shooooes.

Bobby gets a hint of something

BOBBY
(why not ask)
He buy any shoes lately?

SHELLY
No. The police went through everything he owned.

LEO
New shoooes ...

SHELLY
(remembering)
He did have me take a pair of boots in for repair.

BOBBY
When?

SHELLY
Last week.

BOBBY

A weak and pale Phillip Gerard sits in the reception area, attended to by Doc Hayward. The plumber we saw in #006, MR ZIPPER is on a ladder, working on the nozzles of the sprinkler system he's in the middle of installing throughout the station.

CLOSE on a couple of steaming cups of coffee as they're carried into the conference room, where Truman and Cooper, are seated at the table. Wearing surgical gloves, Cooper is paging through the diary they found at Harold Smith's. Open beside him is the original diary they found in Laura's room. Cooper compares the two, takes a sip of coffee.

COOPER
This is Laura's handwriting.

TRUMAN
Why would she keep two diaries?

COOPER
The one we found earlier was a record of events on the
surface. This one apparently tells the story of her inner
life.

TRUMAN
The answer may be in there.

COOPER
Undoubtedly. It's a shame. Mr. Smith saw fit to
mutilate about 45% of the contents.

Hawk enters, carrying an envidence bag containing some torn scraps of paper.

HAWK
This what you're looking for?

COOPER
Precisely.

Cooper opens the bag, takes out the scraps and examines them with a magnifying glass, comparing them to the second diary.

TRUMAN
(to Hawk)
Those are the scraps you found near the railroad car.

Hawk nods.

COOPER
Yes. Yes. This is where the scraps came from.
(opens the book towards the end)
Look at this.

He points to a section torn out near the end of the book.

TRUMAN
Smith ready did a job on this thing.

COOPER
No, look at the way the pages are torn clean, ripped out
at the roots. Smith ripped and slashed his way through,
like the others we found in his apartment.
(a closer detail)
And look at the edges here at the back; yellowed and
curled. Nine pages. They were taken some time ago.

TRUMAN
By Smith?

COOPER
By the killer. The day she died.

Truman takes the book to examine it.

TRUMAN
Before she gave the book to Smith?

COOPER
Unless I'm very much mistaken.

Doc Hayward appears in the doorway, with news, a piece of paper in his hand.

HAYWARD
Excuse me, fellas ...

COOPER
What was Harold Smith's bloodtype, Doc?

HAYWARD
(used to this by now; reads the note in his hand)
"O."

COOPER
The night Laura died Harold Smith never left his
apartment.

HAYWARD
Agent Cooper, just so you know, Gerard is refusing to
take his drug -

COOPER
You mean "Mike."

HAYWARD
Whatever his name is, he's getting weak and unstable. I
can't recommend we let him go much longer without his
medication.

TRUMAN
(reading the diary)
Oh my Lord ... oh my Lord ...

COOPER
Harry?

TRUMAN
(reads)
"... he can can come into my mind, a man who can slip
in and out of you like a wind that goes unnoticed ... it
just struck me that his name is a warning in itself; B-O-
B: Beware of Bob."

Gerard, pale and sweaty, scrutinizes each guest as they are brought before him, shakes his head and they move on. Cooper and Truman stand beside him, Cooper stalwart, Truman exuding a healthy skepticism.

Doc Hayward is nearby, keeping an eye on Gerard.

We're done here, Mr. Horne -

COOPER

Thank you all ladies and gentlemen. If everyone would

HAYWARD
We've got to get him to a bed.

TRUMAN
Mr. Horne, could we have the use of a room?

HORNE
Does he want to check-in?

A look from Cooper asks a favor. Horne complies, points.

HORNE (CONTINUED)

Horne moves to the front desk to retrieve a key.

COOPER

HAYWARD
He needs his medication.

AUDREY
I've spent enough time in bed lately.

BEN
You're looking much, much better.

He tries to kiss her. She turns her cheek. Looks at him. Ben starts evasive actions, checks his desk calender.

BEN (CONTINUED)
Audrey, dear, if you'd excuse me, I've got a business
meeting scheduled -

AUDREY
I know about One-Eyed Jacks.

BEN
What's that?

AUDREY
You heard me.
(moves towards him)
I know about Blackie. I know about Emory Battis. I
know about Ronnette and I know about Laura.

Ben sits. A cold sweat.

BEN
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about -

AUDREY
Dad, I've been listening to you lie and cheat and chisel
all my life. I know every move in your book, so my
advice is: don't waste your breath.

BEN

I see ... your point.

AUDREY
I was there. I saw you.

BEN
Uh-huh.

AUDREY
I need to ask you some so questions.

BEN
Ask away.

AUDREY
No lying.

BEN

I'll do my best.

AUDREY
You'd better do better than that.

BEN
Ask.

AUDREY
Did you have anything to do with my being kidnapped?

BEN
No, I swear on your mother's life -

AUDREY
Leave Mom out of this -

BEN
No. No, no, no. God, no.

AUDREY
Did you know Jean Renault was going to kill Emory and
Blackie?

BEN
Serves them right, doesn't it? They're the ones who
kidnapped you -

AUDREY
Did you know?

BEN
No.

AUDREY
How long have you owned One-Eyed Jacks?

BEN
Five years.

AUDREY
Did you know Laura worked there?

BEN
She was only there a brief time -

AUDREY
Did you know?

BEN
Yes.

AUDREY
Did you in any way encourage her to work there?

BEN
No, I had no idea. She asked for a job at the
department store, Battis sent her without my knowing -

AUDREY
But you found out.

BEN
I saw her there, yes.

AUDREY
Did you sleep with her?

BEN
(pause; very quiet)
Yes.

AUDREY
(pause)
Did you kill her?

Ben's face twists in a contortion of pain and horror. He shakes his head, but we're not sure if it's anger or denial. His voice quavers, tears fill his eyes.

BEN
I ... loved ... her.

He breaks down. Audrey regards her father coldly. She starts away.

BEN (CONTINUED)
What are you doing? Where are you going?
(she's at the door)
What are you going to do?

If I'd thought out what it was going to do to my laundry
bills I never would've let Hank talk me into those

SHELLY
I think they look pretty. Where is he, anyway?

NORMA

He must have some business. Or maybe it's radar; my

allergic to her.

NORMA
Sure. What's up?

What with Leo coming home and everything, you know
I'm supposed to be taking care of him and all and it

job, for a while at least anyway and ... oh shoot ...

Yes. And as soon as you're ready you come right back,

You just try and take a job someplace else and see what
happens.

SHELLY
I don't know what to say.

NORMA
You don't have to say anything.

BIG ED and NADINE enter. Nadine's wearing a girlish outfit. Ed's got a pained expression to match.

NADINE

Nadine drags Ed by the hand to the counter.

Hi Norma, say how long have you been working here?

NORMA

Twenty years in April.

Nadine's brow furrows up. Ed tries to gesture to Norma behind Nadine's back.

NADINE
(decides it's a joke)
You kidder. What a kidder.

ED
'Bout six weeks now, isn't it Norma?

NORMA
(playing along)
That's right.

NADINE
You see? Your parents drag you off to Europe or
someplace for a month and it's like you've been gone
forever - two chocolate shakes please, Norma, extra
whipped cream on mine - hi, what's your name?

SHELLY
(completly mystified)
Shelly.

NADINE
Are you in our class at school?

SHELLY
I don't think so.

NORMA
Europe?

NADINE
Yeah. They love it so much they're still over there, can
you believe it? So they said it was okay for me to stay
over at Eddie's, isn't that right, Eddie?

ED
That's right.

Another helpless gesture to Norma

NADINE
(a confidential tone)
Say Norma, you're not mad or anything that Eddie and
I are sort of going out or anything are you?

NORMA
You and Ed?
(Ed shakes his head at her)
No. No. Why should I be?

NADINE
No reason. I know you two broke up and everything.
I'm just so sweet on him is all.
(cuddles up)
Isn't he just the dreamiest? I can't wait for the start of
football season, can you?

NORMA
No. Can't wait.

NADINE
Me neither.

They all look at her. The coffee cup she's been idly toying, with shatters in her hand.

NADINE (CONTINUED)
God, sorry, there's go another one, I have been so clumsy
lately I can hardly believe it.

NORMA
I'll get another one.

SHELLY

Ten grand? No. It's not Christmas, is it? Ten grand?

Bobby, gets up, rummages through a drawer, comes up with a hammer, puts the boots on the table and starts whacking at the heel. The first heel comes off, revealing a small, secret and empty compartment in its hollow center, shows it to Mike.

How about that? Come on Leo, sing with me ...

Bobby sings, hammering in time to the music on the other boot.

He steps away from the table, picks up a cup of coffe and his microrecorder.

COOPER
(tired and intense)
Diane, it's 5:45 pm, I'm in the conference room with the
remains of Laura Palmer's diary. A great deal of it has
been destroyed, many of Laura's secrets along with it.
Much of what I've been able to decipher supports the
contention of the one-armed man; there are repeated
references to "Bob". He was a threatening presence in her
life from early adolescence. There are intimations of
abuse, molestation. On a regular basis. He is referred
to, on more than one occasion, as a friend of her father's.
And I've just uncovered this entry, dated less than two
weeks before her death.
(reads from diary)
"One of these days I'm going to tell the world about
Ben Horne. I'm going to tell the world who Ben Horne
really is."

The door swings open. Audrey Horne is standing in the doorway.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Audrey ...

Cooper turns off the tape recorder. Audrey enters, closes the door behind her.

AUDREY
I had to see you, I'm sorry -

COOPER
Are you all right?

She waves off the question. Something much larger looming over her. Trying to bear up under its weight.

AUDREY
I spoke with my father.

COOPER
Okay.

AUDREY
He was sleeping with her. With Laura. I don't know for
how long. Maybe quite a while.

COOPER
(quiet, soothing)
Okay.

AUDREY
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's. Working there. My
father owns the place. That's what I found out.

COOPER
Are you sure?

AUDREY
Yes.

Cooper takes her by the shoulders.

COOPER

I don't want you to have to testify. I'm going to try to

AUDREY

What are you gonna do?

COOPER
Don't say a word to anyone. Go home. Stay in your

phone -

Truman appears in the doorway.

AUDREY
You're going, to arrest him.

COOPER
Yes.

She gently disengages herself from him, nods. Tries to smile, but the attempt fails.

AUDREY
I've got to tell Johnny.

COOPER
Why don't you do that?

AUDREY
(faint)
Okay.

She moves out like a sleepwalker.

Come with us now or would you rather go out through
your lobby in handcuffs.

HORNE
Cooper, what kind of a sick joke is this?

COOPER
You'd better do as he says.

They take him by the arms. Horne struggles, yelling, composure completely gone.

HORNE
No! No! You can't do this! You can't do this!

Truman and Hawk drag him out the door, Cooper follows

Tojamura watches them exit. His eyes are bright. He may be laughing.

29. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

Dim light. In his bathrobe and slippers, Pete putters around the kitchen, humming, heating up a glass of milk. Far off he hears a gust of wind, the sound of a door in the distance. He looks up, nothing, finishes fixing his milk. Takes the glass, at a last minute grabs a cookie and heads off. He comes around the corner and nearly screams when he finds himself nearly face to face with Tojamura.

PETE
Who the heck are you?

Tojamura advances towards him, doesn't say a word.

PETE (CONTINUED)
(retreating slightly)
How'd you get in here? Hey - hey!

Tojamura grabs him and kisses him. Pete drops the glass of milk to the floor. Pete struggles. Tojamura pulls back from the embrace. Pete frantically tries to wipe off his lips.

TOJAMURA
Since the moment we met, I've found myself strangely
attracted to you.

PETE
Mister, you better get out of here -

TOJAMURA
There's something about your eyes; they're warm and
deep -
(no trace of an accent; Catherine's voice)
- and blue as the open sky.

PETE
(now he's really confused)
Huh?

TOJAMURA
Pete ... it's me.
(no response; less patient)
It's Catherine, you dummy.

Tojamura takes off his glasses. Pete sees something he recognizes. Tears come to his eyes.

PETE
Oh my God ... you look terrible.

30. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

Truman, Cooper and Hawk enter with Ben Horne. The Log Lady is waiting in the reception area; she rises. Cooper notices her, looks to Truman.

TRUMAN
(to Hawk)
Take Mr. Horne down to the holding cell.

Hawk and Horne move off. Cooper moves to the Log Lady, Truman follows.

LOG LADY
(quiet, intense)
You must go to the Roadhouse. Everything points that
way.

COOPER
Why?

LOG LADY
(a gesture to her log)
It won't say. But it insists.

Cooper looks at Truman.

TRUMAN
We can't question Horne 'til his lawyer gets here; he's
flying back from Japan, won't be here 'til morning. I
could use a beer myself.

COOPER
(another look at the Log Lady)
All right.

CUT TO:


31. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

A band is playing on stage. DONNA HAYWARD enters. She looks for and finds where James is seated, his back to her, reading.

DONNA
You heard about Harold Smith?

JAMES
Yeah.

She sits. James sets the book down. They look at each other.

JAMES (CONTINUED)
It's not your fault, Donna

DONNA
(hurting)
No?

JAMES
I don't think it's anybody's fault. He was a sick guy.

DONNA
He wasn't bad.

JAMES
You don't think he killed Laura?

DONNA
I don't think so. I think he was ... mixed up. I think he
was hurt inside in a way I didn't understand.

JAMES
Everybody's hurt inside. That doesn't mean you can go
around trying to knock somebody's brains out.

DONNA
I think he was defending himself. His life was in that
room, his whole life, and we violated that -

JAMES
Donna, are you defending him?

DONNA
No. But he didn't kill Laura. Maybe he was sick and
what he did was wrong. But he didn't deserve to die for
it.

JAMES
You better be clear about this; that was his choice. If he
didn't want to live there was nothing you or the police or
anybody could do to change that.

DONNA
(a sad realization)
Kind of like Laura.

JAMES
I guess so.

DONNA
(rueful)
God ... nobody told us life was going to be like this.

James takes her hand.

JAMES
Maybe nobody knew.

They look at each other other, draw some comfort from the thought.

JAMES (CONTINUED)
Go for a ride?

She nods. Tears in her eyes. They exit. We pick up and stay with Cooper and Truman as they enter through another door, move to the bar and order beers. The singer on stage begins a new song.

TRUMAN
What do we do?

COOPER
I don't know. Wait.

They watch the band; it's an emotional song, filled with regret and longing. People lean forward, drawn in by the song, but also by a mounting, palpable sense of tension and fear in the air.

Cooper picks up on it, looks at Truman, who feels it as well.

INTERCUT:


32. COOPER'S POV - THE STAGE

In mid-song, the band vanishes from the stage; the Giant appears in the center of the stage. He looks right at Cooper.

GIANT
It's happening again. It's happening again.

Cooper appears to be the only one who sees him. He looks again, unsure of what he's seen. The Giant fades away, replaced by the band once again, who finish the song.

Cooper sits stock still, shocked by what he's seen. Truman looks at him.

TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper?

Someone pats Cooper on the shoulder. Cooper looks up. It's the old ROOM SERVICE WAITER from the Great Northern Hotel. His eyes are filled with tears. He shakes his head, pats Cooper on the shoulder again and moves off.

Cooper stares straight ahead.

COOPER
He's killed again.

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Food is interesting. For instance, why do we need to eat? Why are we never satisfied with just the right amount of food to maintain good health and proper energy? We always seem to want more and more. When eating too much, the proper balance is disturbed and ill health follows. Of course, eating too little food throws the balance off in the opposite direction and there is the ill health coming at us again. Balance is the key. Balance is the key to many things. Do we understand balance? The word balance has seven letters. Seven is difficult to balance, but not impossible if we are able to divide. There are, of course, the pros and cons of division.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

INSERT: CLOSE-UP HOMECOMING PHOTOGRAPH

We view a CLOSE-UP on the photograph of LAURA PALMER'S homecoming queen picture. There is a TAPPING sound in the room. We slowly PAN to the LEFT to view another photograph of LAURA as a young girl and yet another of her as a very young teenager. We PAN DOWN to a sofa chair that has golf balls and golf tees scattered on it. We PAN DOWN further to the floor where a golf ball rolls by. As we PAN the floor to the RIGHT, several more golf balls are revealed clumped together near a small faux turf putting green rug. Someone in a pair of black shoes and holding a golf club is putting at the green.


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing in the living room, LELAND PALMER holds a golf club. With a ball positioned on the green, he winds up and gives the ball a pretty good whack that sends it flying into the wall and bouncing back into the room. Using the golf club, LELAND pulls a golf ball from the clump on the floor over to the putting green. Again, he winds up and hits the ball. There is a KNOCK at the front door. Still holding the golf club, LELAND moves over to the door to answer it.

LELAND opens the door to reveal DONNA HAYWARD and JAMES HURLEY.

LELAND
Hey, Donna.

DONNA
Hi.

LELAND
James.

JAMES
Hi.

LELAND
Come on in.

LELAND walks back into the living room. DONNA and JAMES follow right behind him.

DONNA
Uh we just came to say goodbye to Maddy.

LELAND turns to face them.

LELAND
Oh I'm sorry you just missed her. In fact, I dropped her off at the bus station not ... twenty minutes ago.

JAMES
She's gone?

LELAND
Yes.

LELAND cocks an eyebrow at them.

LELAND
She thought that you were coming over last night?

JAMES
Uhm, did she say anything?

LELAND
Well I would have to say that she was uh just a little bit disappointed.

Standing near a corner halfway up the stairs, SARAH PALMER, with her hair all frazzled and wearing a robe, calls out for LELAND.

SARAH
Leland?! Leland honey?!

We FOCUS back on LELAND as he politely tells DONNA and JAMES ...

LELAND
Excuse me.

LELAND walks off to tend to SARAH. Disappointed, JAMES turns to DONNA.

MUSIC: MONTAGE FROM TWIN PEAKS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME

JAMES and DONNA look into the living room. Golf balls are scattered all about the room. JAMES and DONNA start to giggle at the sight of the odd mess.

We FOCUS on LELAND walking back down the stairs after tending to SARAH. LELAND stops for a moment as he thinks of something and then brandishes a wicked smile before he continues to walk down the stairs.

LELAND joins DONNA and JAMES in the living room.

LELAND
You know, if you'd like, you could write her. I'm sure she'd be glad to hear from ya'.

DONNA
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

LELAND
Hey no bother, no bother. (smiles) Say hi to your folks for me Donna.

DONNA
Okay.

LELAND
Okay.

DONNA and JAMES head towards the door.

JAMES
Goodbye Mr. Palmer.

LELAND
Bye James. Take it easy now.

JAMES
Alright.

LELAND closes the door behind them. He moves over to a mirror on the wall next to the door to adjust his tie.


LELAND’S POV:

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:19)

Through LELAND’S CLOSE-UP POV on the mirror, LELAND looks at his reflection as he adjusts his tie. As he stares into the mirror his image is replaced with the image of BOB, a frightening long-haired man wearing a jean jacket. The image of BOB fades away and LELAND'S reflection in the mirror returns as he shakes his head.


BACK TO SCENE:

LELAND walks back toward the living room but SARAH shouts out to him from the second floor.

SARAH (OFF SCREEN)
Leland?

LELAND pauses right at doorway from the foyer. He grips his golf club before him with both hands like a sword.

LELAND
Yes dear.

SARAH (OFF SCREEN)
Remember to sign us up for the Grand River Night at the Club.

LELAND
Oh, don't worry dear I won't forget.

LELAND turns around and moves back to the foyer.


BIRD’S-EYE POV:

From a view looking down inside a dark closet, we watch the door open as LELAND reaches in and grabs a long coat. He puts the coat on and then reaches down to grab a very large black golf bag. LELAND unzips the bag to reveal a bloodied clear plastic and a hand inside the bag. He stuffs his golf club inside the bag and zips it back up.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:19)

LELAND carries the bag with a strap over his shoulder. Before he leaving the house, LELAND shouts to SARAH.

LELAND places his large golf bag in trunk of his car. He closes the large trunk lid of his blue convertible. Cold, he rubs his gloved hands as he walks over to the driver side door but before he steps inside he lifts his head up and exhales. LELAND whistles a tune as he steps into his car and starts it up. He unlocks two clasps that hold the convertible top down and activates a motor that folds it back. As the top folds back, LELAND backs the car out of the driveway as he hums the tune he was whistling.




CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CELL BLOCK - DAY

Behind the bars of a jail cell in the basement of the building, BENJAMIN HORNE wipes at the dirty bars with his handkerchief. He walks over to a small and very dirty sink in the corner of the cell and whips his handkerchief at it to dust if off. Disgusted BEN mumbles ...

BENJAMIN
God.

LELAND grabs a toothbrush, applies toothpaste to the bristles and proceeds to brush his teeth.

Just outside the main door to the cell block, JERRY HORNE is escorted by a DEPUTY who unlocks and opens the door.

JERRY
It smells like a toilet in here!

With a Japanese flag attached to his lapel, JERRY calls out to his brother BEN.

JERRY
Konietchwa??? Uson???.

The DEPUTY unlocks and opens the jail cell door to BEN'S cell and lets JERRY in.

BENJAMIN
Jerry, what the hell took you so long?

BEN listens to JERRY as he brushes his teeth.

JERRY
Oh jeez, datelines, time zones, I don't even know where I am.

JERRY looks his brother BEN over, who is unshaved and has his tie untied around his neck.

JERRY
God you look terrible.

BEN looks himself over.

BENJAMIN
Jerry.

BEN holds his arms out for a hug.

JERRY
Ben.

JERRY holds his arms out and they both hug each other and pat each other on the back.

JERRY
Well Ben, since your regular mouth piece has been charged with murder himself, I'm going to be handling your case personally. So, let's get started. Did you kill her?

BENJAMIN
Jerry, for God sakes.

JERRY takes a seat on the lower bed of the bunk bed beside him.

JERRY
Sorry you’re right. The last thing a good defense attorney needs to know is the truth.

JERRY opens his briefcase and pulls out a pipe and lighter. BEN finishes up with brushing his teeth at the sink and cleans up. JERRY lights up his pipe.

BENJAMIN
Jerry can you get me out of here?

JERRY
They can only hold you for 24 hours without charging you. Or is it 48?

BEN shakes his head and then takes a seat next to JERRY on the bunk bed. JERRY reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a book to check the right number of hours required.

BENJAMIN
Ohh, Jerry, Jerry I am in trouble here.

JERRY tosses the book to the ground.

JERRY
Under control big brother.

JERRY pats his brother BEN on the back to comfort him.

JERRY
Okay, so where are we saying you were on the night Laura died?

BENJAMIN
I was with Catherine.

JERRY
That's not a good choice.

BEN grabs a cigar out of his interior suit pocket and bites the end off.

BENJAMIN
It happens to be the truth.

BEN goes through all of his pockets looking for a lighter.

JERRY
Oh dear. Is there any sign of her?

BEN finds his lighter. BEN nods his head for no as he lights his cigar.

JERRY
Bone - bone fragments or teeth?

BEN nods his head for no again as he mumbles ...

BENJAMIN
Nah.

JERRY
(wisecrack) Charred corroborating note regarding your whereabouts?

BEN again nods his head for no as he puffs away at his cigar.

JERRY
I'm so depressed.

JERRY stands up and walks away to the corner of the cell where the sink is positioned. JERRY turns around to BEN and, with a gleam in his eye, notices the ...

JERRY
Bunk beds.

JERRY moves to the bunk bed and climbs to the top bunk by using the lower bunk bed as a foot ladder. JERRY lies on his side.

JERRY
Do you remember our first room Ben? Me on the top bunk and you on the bottom bunk ... and Louise Dombrowski dancing on the hook rug with a flashlight.

BEN starts to smile as he recalls that memory.

Holding a flashlight, LOUSIE, wearing a skirted dress and no shoes, starts to sway and swing the flashlight around as she dances on a hook rug in the middle of the room. A young BENJAMIN HORNE sits on the floor next to the bunk bed where a young JERRY HORNE is laying, on his stomach, as they watch her dance. As the flashlight passes the faces of BEN and JERRY, who are both wearing glasses, they smile brightly as LOUSIE sways and moves to the music.

At the outer set of double doors to the building, LUCY MORAN opens the door for her sister GWEN who is holding her BABY, bundled in a blue blanket, in her arms.

GWEN
You know the first time I went in they thought it was my bladder, so they checked it again.

GWEN steps in and moves aside so that LUCY can open the door to the inner set of double doors to the building. Holding a teddy bear, a plush rabbit toy, a baby bottle and carrying a bag over her shoulder, LUCY opens and holds the door so that GWEN can pass.

GWEN
It was an infection. I hadn't even been near a rust - rusty nail.

As LUCY steps inside the building she drops the items in her arms to the floor. As her sister GWEN continues to gab away, LUCY bends down to retrieve the items she dropped and then they both walk into the building.

GWEN
I mean, you remember that time my toe turned purple right. So instead I took a bath in baking soda and then my toe came around but I got the worst cramps like ...

As he walks out from the coffee station, LUCY asks DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL ...

LUCY
Have you seen Andy?

GWEN

GWEN asks HAWK a question before he can reply to LUCY.

GWEN
Oh you must be that native person I heard so much about uhm Eagle Eye?

GWEN turns to LUCY as she guesses badly at HAWK'S name. HAWK corrects her.

HAWK
Hawk.

HAWK asks LUCY ...

HAWK
Sister?

LUCY
Oh yeah this is my sister Gwen. (to GWEN) This is Hawk.

GWEN and HAWK shake hands.

GWEN
Oh, its a pleasure to meet you. God how you must hate us white people after all we've done to you.

HAWK
Some of my best friends are white people.

HAWK shrugs slightly, turns around and walks away down the hall. GWEN and LUCY walk up the hall. GWEN returns to gabbing with LUCY

GWEN
Oh. Anyway, (to the somewhat restless BABY in her arms) oh come on, (back to LUCY) my stomach ...

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

Looking down a hallway of the hotel, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER and SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN walk around the left corner at the end of the hall.

We FOCUS on COOPER and TRUMAN as they walk up the hallway. COOPER talks into his mini tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane, 10:03 am, Great Northern Hotel. Sheriff Truman and I have just been with the one-armed man or what's left of him. In another time, another culture he may have been a seer, a shaolin priest. In our world he's a shoe salesman and lives among the shadows.

With the a CLICK, COOPER turns the recorder off.

AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN enter the lobby of the hotel.


COOPER’S POV:

MUSIC: BIG BAND

Through COOPER'S POV several people are in the room moving about but we FOCUS on LELAND, holding a golf club in his hands, as he prances and dances around the room. Dancing like Fred Astaire, LELAND hops on a sofa chair with a foot at the head of the chair and rides it down as the chair falls back.


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing just outside the hallway they came from and wearing a puzzled look, COOPER points out ...

COOPER
Leland Palmer.

Using his golf club like a cane, LELAND holds the club under his arm and dances backward and right in front of a BELL HOP that has his hands full with several suitcases. As the BELL HOP tries to move around LELAND, LELAND moves back and into his way.

BELL HOP
Opps, excuse me.

LELAND
Woah.

The BELL HOP finally gets around LELAND who continues to dance. A few people in the room watch LELAND as he dances. COOPER and TRUMAN walk into the lobby.

COOPER
Does he know we arrested Ben Horne?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doesn't look like it.

COOPER
Harry, best if he heard it from you.

LELAND glides and tosses the club from hand to hand as people walk by him. As the music comes to an end, people in the room applaud his dancing.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

LELAND continues to dance until the music stops and his last few dance steps land him right in front of SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER.

MUSIC ENDS: BIG BAND

LELAND
(smiling) Hi Harry, Agent Cooper. Just having a little fun.

LELAND grasps his golf club vertically in his hands before him

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Looking good Leland.

LELAND
Just call me Fred.

LELAND laughs and smiles brightly. Straight faced, TRUMAN puts a hand on LELAND'S shoulder.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland, I'm sorry ... we didn't want you to hear it from anyone else. We've arrested Ben Horne for Laura's murder.

Shocked by the news LELAND loses his smile.

LELAND
Huh?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He hasn't been charged but we're holding him.

LELAND
Ben?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's right.

Still surprised and with a skeptical chuckle LELAND asks ...

LELAND
There must be some mistake Harry? Ben? I thought that Jacques Renault had ...

COOPER
No.

LELAND
You have a strong case against him?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes we do.

LELAND closes his eyes, bends his head down to rest his forehead on the butt of the golf club but with his eyes still closed lifts his head back up.

LELAND
Oh.

COOPER
Will you be alright Leland?

LELAND
Uh ... yeah. The law will handle this.

COOPER
As it should be.

LELAND opens his eyes.

LELAND
Thanks Harry, Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pats LELAND'S shoulder. LELAND walks away. SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER turn to watch him walk off.


COOPER’S POV:

Through AGENT COOPER'S POV, LELAND, with his head bowed down, slowly walks toward the open double doors of an adjacent room. Shaken, LELAND pauses and puts a hand out to lean on the doorway before he enters the next room. By walking to his left, LELAND moves out of view.


BACK TO SCENE:

In the room adjacent to the lobby, LELAND rests his forehead on the butt of the golf club he clutches vertically in his hands before him. LELAND grovels as he weeps in a snide fashion as he remembers the death of his daughter.

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:15)

But with a grin, the groveling quickly turns to a wicked giggle as LELAND lifts his head and peers up. LELAND shakes his head slightly at the perverse joy in hearing that yet another person is taking the blame for LAURA'S murder.

In the lobby, COOPER peers in the direction that LELAND walked off to.

COOPER
Harry, I'll catch up with you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks off. COOPER walks toward the adjacent room.


COOPER’S POV:

Through AGENT COOPER'S POV, COOPER slowly moves toward the doorway to the next room, turns to the left and sees the back of LELAND. LELAND, standing in front of a red curtain that covers a doorway, has his head bowed down and appears to be groveling.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00-0:15)

COOPER
Leland?


CLOSE ON: LELAND’S FACE

With a CLOSE-UP view of LELAND'S face, LELAND still wears a wicked grin and snickers although its mistaken by COOPER as groveling. Upon hearing COOPER, LELAND quickly loses the grin, stops snickering and lifts his head up. With fear in his eyes that he might have been caught laughing LELAND quickly replies ...

LELAND
Yes.

COOPER
If you can remember anything unusual about Mr. Horne's behavior the night of Laura's death would you please let me know.


BACK TO SCENE:

LELAND turns to the side slightly as he answers ...

LELAND
I will, of course.


CLOSE ON: LELAND’S FACE

LELAND returns his back to COOPER, peers up and brandishes a wicked grin.

COOPER
Thank you.

AGENT COOPER walks away. Overjoyed, LELAND can hardly contain himself as he giggles tightlipped at the situation he is in. LELAND expresses a thought with the jump in his brow in the ways he could help AGENT COOPER. LELAND suppresses the giggle and straightens himself up.


BACK TO SCENE:

In the mostly deserted lobby of the hotel, AGENT COOPER walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Everything okay?

COOPER
I'm not sure.

COOPER and TRUMAN walk off.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PACKAGE

We view a CLOSE-UP on a white paper package as a pair of hands unfold the paper back to reveal a new pair of disposable surgical gloves.


BACK TO SCENE:

DR. WILL HAYWARD puts the surgical gloves on and tugs on the end of the gloves, with the sound of SNAPPING rubber, to fully seat his hands in the gloves. BENJAMIN HORNE is seated at a table in the middle of the room. His brother JERRY HORNE sits beside him. AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN stand in a corner of the room facing BEN and JERRY. DR. HAYWARD grabs BEN'S index finger and holds it.

DR. HAYWARD
This won't hurt a bit.

JERRY stands up.

JERRY
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment of my client after all this man has done for this town.

DR. HAYWARD
Now hold still.

Holding BEN'S index finger with his left hand and a needle in his right hand, DR. HAYWARD quickly pokes the finger with the needle. Not aware until he feels it, BEN outbursts slightly.

BENJAMIN
Oww!

DR. HAYWARD squeezes the finger to draw some blood. Using a syringe with a long, thin plastic tube, DR. HAYWARD collects some of the blood for a test sample. As soon as DR. HAYWARD releases the finger, BEN quickly puts it in his mouth.

DR. HAYWARD
I'll have the results in a couple of hours.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks doc.

DR. HAYWARD collects his things, puts them in his bag and leaves the room. JERRY leans on BEN'S shoulder.

JERRY
Gentlemen, I demand that my client either be released or charged. Never in all my years of practicing law have I witnessed such a complete and utter disregard for an accused man's constitutional rights.

JERRY
Hey I'm not on trial here.

COOPER
Sit down.

JERRY takes a seat next to his brother BEN. AGENT COOPER walks toward the table and tosses LAURA'S diary on the tabletop.

COOPER
Mr. Horne do you know what this is?

JERRY moves over to BEN'S ear and whispers ...

JERRY
A book.

BEN answers to COOPER ...

BENJAMIN
A book.

BEN reaches into his coat pocket, pulls out his eyeglasses and puts them on. COOPER picks the book up and flips through the pages as he holds it in front of BEN so that BEN can view its contents.

COOPER
Take a closer look.

BENJAMIN
A diary.

BEN twiddles his thumbs and looks away as COOPER speaks.

COOPER
We all know about One-Eyed Jacks. So did Laura. Some day I'm going to tell the world all about Ben Horne. I'm going to tell them who he really is.

COOPER
But she never got the chance did she? Come on Ben, we're all adults here. Wild, young girl like Laura Palmer, things spin out of control. She becomes a threat, not just to you but to your business, your family.

Slightly angered, BEN points a finger at COOPER.

BENJAMIN
You’re way out of line.

COOPER
Well maybe you don't have anything to hide. That's not what it says in here.

You can not ...

JERRY stands up to calm his brother.

JERRY
Ben.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks over to the table.

You can not, ...

TRUMAN puts a hand on BEN'S shoulder and pushes him down.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sit down.

BENJAMIN

Starring at TRUMAN, BEN calms down and sits back down.

Sitting in the kitchen in front of a stereo tape player with a microphone plugged in, BOBBY BRIGGS, wearing a bandanna on his head and clutching a pen in his mouth, plays the contents of the microaudiocassette he found in LEO'S boot on a handheld miniature tape player.

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The mill?

BOBBY stops the tape and rewinds it. He depresses a button on the stereo tape player to record the audio from the microcassette using the microphone. We hear the contents on the tape as BOBBY turns the mini tape player on again.

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The mill?

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Keep it simple. Insurance investigators should read arson, block letters about uh six feet high.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The deal as we discussed?

BOBBY stops the two tape players, grabs the pen from his mouth and writes on a note pad on top of the stereo tape player.

BOBBY
Ben Horne ... his voice and Leo Johnson's voice.

Dumbfounded, BOBBY shakes his head at the relation between the two men.

BOBBY
Ben and Leo?


INSERT: CLOSE-UP NOTEPAD

We view a CLOSE-UP on the notepad that BOBBY is writing on. The contents on the pad read ...

BOBBY
Special delivery for Mr. Horne.


BACK TO SCENE:

BOBBY tears the note from the notepad, folds it up and stuffs it into an envelope. SHELLY JOHNSON calls out from the next room ...

SHELLY (OFF SCREEN)
Bobby.

BOBBY looks into the next room but doesn't see anything. He opens the tape deck on the stereo tape player, removes the tape and places it in the envelope. From the kitchen, a glass can be heard SHATTERING against the floor.

SHELLY (OFF SCREEN)
Oh god, Bobby!

BOBBY licks the glue seal on the envelope and closes it up. Wearing a blue silk nightgown, SHELLY, splattered with pudding, walks over to BOBBY carrying a bowl of pudding.

SHELLY
He did it again. Its your turn to clean him this time.

SHELLY puts the bowl by the sink. BOBBY tosses the unaddressed letter to the cluttered and dirty kitchen table. As BOBBY moves to kiss her neck below her jaw, SHELLY notices the letter.

SHELLY
What's that?

BOBBY
That is our ship.

SHELLY
What's that mean?

SHELLY picks the slightly soiled letter up. BOBBY stands behind her with his hands resting on her shoulders.

BOBBY
Since our cash cow in the other room has turned into a sink hole, I've decided to pursue a career in business.

Using a towel, SHELLY wipes some of pudding from her neck.

SHELLY
Really, like a salesman?

BOBBY kisses her hair and then the side of her face.

BOBBY
Uhm no, I'm thinking more executive suite.

SHELLY turns around to face him.

SHELLY
Really?

BOBBY
Yeah.

Using his index finger, BOBBY wipes a speck of pudding from her chest and moves it to her lips.

SHELLY
Bobby that sounds great.

SHELLY lightly and playfully bites the tip of his finger before she licks the pudding off.

BOBBY
I'm going to give you ... anything you want.

BOBBY cradles the bottom of her head. As he touches her neck he gets some pudding on his thumb so he quickly licks it off.

SHELLY
I want a full time nanny.

BOBBY
Maybe a French maid.

SHELLY
(scoldingly) Bobby.

She playfully slaps his right arm. They quickly and passionately kiss each other.

NORMA JENNINGS carries a cup of coffee and a plate of carrots, mashed potatoes and meatloaf over to TOAD, who is seated at the island counter. TOAD stuffs a napkin into the top of his shirt like a bib as NORMA puts the plate and cup before him. VIVIAN NILES, the mother of NORMA with similar features, walks into the diner and up to counter island next to TOAD.

VIVIAN
Hello Norma.

Surprised, NORMA smiles brightly.

NORMA
Mother.

VIVIAN
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes?

NORMA
(nods yes) Real potatoes.

VIVIAN
(to TOAD) Excuse me.

TOAD shakes a bottle of ketchup. VIVIAN pushes TOAD'S hand holding the ketchup as she grabs a fork and helps herself to a sample of the mash potatoes on TOAD'S plate.

NORMA
What a nice ... surprise to see you here.

VIVIAN
Hmm, hey those are good. I see they taught Henry some skill in the stockade. Where is your charming husband?

NORMA
Hank? He's not here right now.

VIVIAN quips a discerning eye.

VIVIAN
I see.

NORMA
Mother, I got your message but if you don't mind my asking, what are you doing here?

The door to the diner chimes as ERNIE 'THE PROFESSOR' NILES steps into the diner, walks next to VIVIAN and puts his arm around her.

VIVIAN
I want to introduce you to my new husband.

NORMA
Husband?

VIVIAN
Ernie, this is Norma.

ERNIE
Hi, how are ya'.

NORMA and ERNIE shake hands.

VIVIAN
We're honeymooning.

Giddy, VIVIAN and ERNIE smile and chuckle.

ERNIE
Norma I wonder if I could bother you for a cup of coffee?

NORMA walks off to fetch the cup of coffee. ERNIE tells VIVIAN ...

ERNIE
Nice girl.

VIVIAN
She's darling.

ERNIE kisses VIVIAN on the temple and then walks aside to talk into a cellular phone. NORMA listens to her mother as she pours a cup of coffee near the coffee maker.

VIVIAN
Ernie's a financial analysis. I just love what you've done with your diner darling. The flowers add such a measure of cheer.

Busy on the phone, ERNIE turns around and catches the last portion of VIVIAN'S sentence and mistakenly assumes it about himself.

ERNIE
Oh thank you, thank you so much. Nice to see those good looks haven't isolated themselves to one generation.

ERNIE walks away and returns to his phone conversation.

ERNIE
Now let's go over those figures.

NORMA
(to VIVIAN) Excuse me.

NORMA cringes slightly and walks away to the cook order window. VIVIAN follows her.

VIVIAN
You still look very smart in that uniform. Your figure's lovely it hasn't changed.

NORMA
Now I don't mean to be rude but how long will you be staying?

NORMA grabs a handful of paper napkins and a sugar dispenser.

VIVIAN
Uhm a couple of days. Ernie wanted to see something of the country. Why?

NORMA walks back to the island counter and refills a napkin dispenser. Still on the phone, ERNIE can be seen in the background.

NORMA
I just wish I had known that's all.

VIVIAN
Oh I didn't mean for you to go into any fuss. You know me dear I'm easy. What's wrong?

NORMA
Nothing, its ... just that there's a food critic coming and ... I'm short on help that's all.

VIVIAN
Food critic, ahh. So that's why you've tried so hard to make the place look nice.

Twiddling with his phone in his right hand, ERNIE walks up to VIVIAN.

ERNIE
Norma, hoping to spend much more time with ya'. If its alright with you Vivian we'd better check in. I've got a Tokyo fax waiting for me at the desk.

VIVIAN
We'll be at the Great Northern. I'm sorry we missed Henry. I'll call you later okay.

NORMA
Bye.

VIVIAN
Okay bye.

ERNIE
Nice to meet ya'.

With his arm cradled behind her, ERNIE and VIVIAN walk away and leave the diner. NORMA cleans the counter and picks up the newspaper ERNIE left behind. As she picks it up she notices some writing on the newspaper.

Unresponsive as she blows her bubble gum, a NURSE seated at the foot of the bed looks at the ONE-ARMED MAN as his left shoulder moves. The ONE-ARMED MAN awakens in his ‘MIKE’ state and peers up into the room.

ONE-ARMED MAN
He’s close.

The ONE-ARMED MAN politely asks the NURSE, who is now standing at the foot of the bed ...

ONE-ARMED MAN
Could I have a glass of water please?

NURSE
Yes sir.

The NURSE walks out of the room. As she exits the hotel bedroom she passes a DEPUTY on guard, who is seated and reading a newspaper. As the NURSE walks down the hall to retrieve a glass of water, the DEPUTY stands up and checks her out. The DEPUTY tosses his newspaper to his chair and slowly walks into the open door of the hotel bedroom to check on the ONE-ARMED MAN. As the DEPUTY walks past the corner of the bathroom and to the foot of the bed, the ONE-ARMED MAN strikes a blow to the DEPUTY’S head with a mounted ornament from the nightstand. The DEPUTY quietly falls to floor. The ONE-ARMED MAN looks down on the DEPUTY.

HANK
Hi Norma. I guess I'm a little late.

HANK closes the flip-up door behind himself and takes off his jacket.

NORMA
Forty-eight hours is not late Hank, its missing.

HANK places his jacket on the counter and moves to the center cabinet shelf to grab an apron.

HANK
I’m sorry it was some ... some business I had to take care of.

Angry, NORMA turns to berate HANK.

NORMA
Business! No, this is business! This is a place where you come to whether you feel like it or not.

NORMA turns back around to continue cutting the pies. Working near the cook order window, VIVIAN turns to listen in on the quarrel between HANK and NORMA.

HANK
Norma I - I ...

HANK reaches out to hold NORMA’S shoulders but she quickly turns around, pushing him away.

NORMA
PLEASE don’t sweet talk me I’m this far away from telling you to take a hike.

NORMA indicates an inch with her hand. VIVIAN walks closer but hides behind the giant coffee maker as she listens and watches the two argue. NORMA turns back to finish the pies.

HANK
Norma please don’t make that kind of judgment till you hear me out. Because of the bad choices I’ve made there are people out there ... people from my past who want to see me fail. I’ve tried fighting them but I just get into more trouble. I’ve tried running from them but there's always somebody faster. I know its no way for a man to live his life but sometimes its just best to hold up and wait for the storm to past.

HANK strokes NORMA’S hair and then holds her shoulders.

HANK
I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

NORMA turns around to face HANK.

NORMA
Maybe next time you'll ask for a little help.

Relieved, HANK exhales and smiles.

PETE laughs and then moves to his right. BEN follows him from behind the bars as he listens to the tape.

CATHERINE

PETE laughs again.

PETE throws BEN a stern stare and then quickly opens the cell block door and leaves. BEN jumps to his jail cell door and rattles it. Enraged, BEN flings a tin cup on the sink to the ground. He grabs the mattress on the top bunk and throws it on the ground. Next, he grabs the metal frame of the bunk bed and jerks it back and forth.

BEN reaches down, grabs the pillows and swings them against the bars of the cell which rips them open and sends their contents of white goose feathers flying through the air.

COOPER
Uh yes Leland. I enjoy its precision.

Doing a doubletake, HAWK turns his head back at the scene to his right.

GWEN
I would be out shopping and then 'boom' pass right out in the produce section.

HAWK and the ONE-ARMED MAN walk off up a corridor of the building.

GWEN
Then come to covered in bruises and crushed fruit and strangers standing over me waiting to see if I was dead. You see people want terrible things to happen to you, I know.

Annoyed by the gabbing of GWEN, ANDY gives GWEN a slightly stern and blank look before he turns to LUCY.

ANDY
(intimately whispers) I want to talk ...

Nosey, GWEN moves in closely to hear ANDY.

ANDY
... to you about my sperms.

GWEN
Sperms?

Interrupted, ANDY and LUCY turn to GWEN as she sits back and laughs.

GWEN
You know that is all men think about. You know, I remember when little Carl was first born and they laid him down on my breast and I look at him and I saw what kind of a tiny little creature I was dealing with and I thought, to myself I thought, my God just what the world needs another sperm come running around loose, right. Women beware.

ANDY again sternly stares at GWEN and so does LUCY. GWEN senses it.

GWEN
Well I did.

ANDY turns to LUCY again but does a doubletake of a brief stern look to GWEN.

ANDY
(intimately whispers) I had mine ...

Once again, GWEN bends down close to butt in and listen to ANDY.

ANDY
... counted twice. The first time they we’re all dead.

ANDY and LUCY turn to GWEN as she interrupts.

GWEN
Oh man, if I had a nickel every time I heard that one.

GWEN leans forward as ANDY quickly turns back to LUCY.

ANDY
(whispered) Second time ...

GWEN
What?

ANDY
... they were ...

GWEN
What?

ANDY
... jumping like - like salmon swimming upstream.

Annoyingly, GWEN sits up and comments ...

GWEN
So of course all you could think of was spawning!

GWEN laughs. ANDY and LUCY bluntly look at GWEN.

ANDY
Shut up.

LUCY
Shut up Gwen.

Wounded, GWEN walks away.

GWEN
Gahh.

Now undisturbed, ANDY turns to LUCY and finishes.

ANDY
So when you told me that you were pregnant I didn’t think it could be me because mine were all dead supposedly at the time.

Unsure considering the impact of ANDY’S story, LUCY mumbles ...

LUCY
Uh-huh.

ANDY
But they got better. I was misinformed. I’m the father.

Confused, LUCY rests her head on the palm of her hand.

LUCY
Oh brother.

ANDY
Aren’t I?

GWEN walks nearby with her baby in her arms. LUCY and ANDY turn their heads to GWEN as they hear sounds from the baby.

GWEN
Oh yeah. Oh come here. You want to see your mean Aunt Lucy.

GWEN snickers at ANDY and LUCY.

GWEN
Oh - ho what’d you make you little snooky-bookems.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK stand behind AGENT COOPER as they watch the ONE-ARMED MAN, in his ‘MIKE’ state, walk around BENJAMIN HORNE. Up against the wall, JERRY HORNE stands behind his brother.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Ohh ... he’s been close.

The ONE-ARMED MAN walks up to COOPER.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Bob is not here now.

JERRY walks away from the wall and up to COOPER but speaks over his shoulder to TRUMAN.

JERRY
Sheriff? Sheriff? Isn’t there something that you'd like to share with us?

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands quietly and doesn’t answer. Puzzled himself, TRUMAN exchanges a questioning glance to HAWK. JERRY walks back to his brother but stops halfway as he is bothered by the stare from the ONE-ARMED MAN.

JERRY
Oh great and will you tell this guy to stop staring at me like I’m a dog biscuit.

After looking JERRY over the ONE-ARMED MAN remarks ...

ONE-ARMED MAN
Bob has been very close.

JERRY asks TRUMAN ...

JERRY
Who’s Bob? I don’t know a Bob?

JERRY turns to BEN.

JERRY
Do we know a Bob?

BEN quietly nods for no. JERRY turns back around to TRUMAN and points at the ONE-ARMED MAN.

JERRY
Sheriff, no offense, but uh clearly this man’s stairs do not reach the attic. Now your twenty-four hours are up!

JERRY points at his brother BEN.

JERRY
You either charge my client or let him go!

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:15)

SHERIFF TRUMAN grabs COOPER’S shoulder, moves him aside and boldly steps forward.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ben Horne, I’m charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer.

BEN wavers in disbelief.

BENJAMIN
(whispers) No.

Angered, BEN turns to his brother JERRY and quips ...

BENJAMIN
Good move Jerr.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(boldly commands) Hawk, take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel. Nail all the windows shut.

HAWK escorts the ONE-ARMED MAN, who wriggles in defiance wanting to continue the search for BOB.

ONE-ARMED MAN
No.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Two men on the door.

ONE-ARMED MAN
No, no.

HAWK and the ONE-ARMED MAN leave the room.

Enraged once more, BEN reaches out to TRUMAN. JERRY tries to hold BEN back.

BENJAMIN
You two bit lumberjack! You are finished in this town!

JERRY
Don’t make it worse.

BEN grabs a hold of TRUMAN’S shirt collar. TRUMAN defiantly stares down BEN as he gets jerked around slightly but TRUMAN pushes BEN off.

BENJAMIN
You’re finished.

JERRY slams BEN against the wall and finally calms him down.

JERRY
Calm down. What are you doing?

AGENT COOPER coolly walks up to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, will you come outside please.

BENJAMIN
I’m alright.

COOPER and TRUMAN walk out of the room, close the door behind themselves and stand slightly away from the door.

COOPER
Harry, I think we’re saddling the horse before we’re ready to ride.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t follow.

COOPER
I don’t think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What?

COOPER
You should release him.

TRUMAN rests his left hand on COOPER’S shoulder and animatedly moves his right hand as he speaks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper? I’ve backed you every step of the way but I’ve had enough of the mumbo-jumbo. I’ve had enough of the dreams, the visions, the dwarfs, the giants, Tibet and the rest of the hocus-pocus.

TRUMAN points at the interrogation room door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now we’ve got hard evidence against Ben Horne and its my job to lock him up.

COOPER
You’re right Harry. This is your back yard sometimes an outsider can forget that.

COOPER walks away down the hall leaving TRUMAN behind. SHERIFF TRUMAN ponders if he made the right decision.

Through VIVIAN’S CLOSE-UP POV of her plate of food, VIVIAN nudges a portion of fish around on her plate with a fork.

VIVIAN
Well the salmon was fresh and firm ...


BACK TO SCENE:

MUSIC: DINNER MUSIC

Seated at a table in the dining area of the hotel, VIVIAN inspects the fish as she pushes it around on her plate.

VIVIAN
... and uh just a little bit overdone.

Sitting across from VIVIAN, ERNIE adds his disappointment of the meal.

ERNIE
Mine too.

With his napkin tucked into the top of his shirt and using both hands as he smacks away at his barbecue ribs, HANK offers his own comment.

HANK
Just right.

Slightly embarrassed by HANK, NORMA looks away and then stands up.

NORMA
Would you excuse me for a minute please?

VIVIAN
I’ll join you.

VIVIAN quickly follows NORMA. ERNIE stands up politely as they leave.

ERNIE
Lady’s hurry back.

With his hands covered in barbecue sauce, HANK slowly rises in turn. ERNIE stares at HANK. HANK smiles and pats ERNIE on the shoulder. Without looking, ERNIE wipes his shoulder with his napkin. They both sit back down. ERNIE leans over to HANK.

ERNIE
You’re not going to say anything are ya’? If Vivian ever found out that I had been inside she’d uh ... she’d dropped me flat.

HANK
I like your new hair color.

They both smile at each other.

HANK
Ernie Niles. Ernie ‘the Professor’ Niles.

HANK licks his fingers on his right hand, wipes them on his napkin and then shakes hands with ERNIE. HANK wears a double four domino on his bolo tie.

ERNIE
So when did you ..?

HANK
Couple weeks ago. Let me tell you Ern, without you in there to pal around with, the last six months were sheer hell. (jokingly) Nobody to go to the library with. Nobody to stamp out license plates with. So uh, what’s your angle here with uh miss moneybags?

ERNIE
No angle.

HANK
Hey come on buddy you don’t have any secrets. Vivian’s rolling in dough.

ERNIE
I met Vivian at a Republican fund raiser. We’re married.

HANK
You must have told her some tall tales, a whopper.

ERNIE
I’m trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth these days. Its uh ... therapeutic. And uh Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.

HANK
Whew, what about yours? Interested in being a loan shark.

ERNIE
I’m out of it, I’m out of it Hank. I’m not gambling any more. I go to meetings. I go to church too.

HANK
So, what happens when Vivian finds out that you ran off with the congregations picnic fund? Ha - ha.

ERNIE
I never stole from a church, it was a savings and loan. I was sick, it was endless you know. I paid my debt. Its a new life, a clean ...

ERNIE nervously checks over his right shoulder to see if the ladies are on their way back.

ERNIE
... clean slate.

HANK
So she really doesn’t know?

ERNIE
No.

HANK removes his napkin from his shirt, wipes his mouth and places the napkin on the table.

HANK
Ernie this is interesting to me because family is the most important thing in the world to me. One must be prepared to pay any price ... to protect it. Don’t you agree?

ERNIE slyly looks at HANK.

ERNIE
Oh yeah - yeah, right, completely agree.

HANK and ERNIE notice the doors to the Timber Room swing open as VIVIAN and NORMA make their way back.

HANK
We’ll talk more later Ernie. I always enjoy our talks in the yard, man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.

HANK and ERNIE politely stand back up as VIVIAN and NORMA return to the table to take a seat.

VIVIAN
We’re back.

ERNIE
Ladies.

Everybody takes a seat at the table except HANK, who picks up his mug of beer.

HANK
I would like to propose a toast to the newlyweds and their happiness.

VIVIAN
Thank you Henry. Its very generous.

HANK
To Ernie and Vivian ... to much success in their future and all their future dealings.

VIVIAN
How sweet.

ERNIE
That’s sweet.

ERNIE, VIVIAN and NORMA pick up their wine glasses and toast them together with HANK’S beer mug. They all then drink from their glasses except for HANK, who slams down his beer as he stands alone. Finished, HANK sits down, wipes his mouth with his napkin and lets out a small burp. ERNIE shakes his head slightly at HANK’S crudeness.

Suspicious that something is up between the two, NORMA stares at HANK, moves her gaze over to ERNIE and then back to HANK.

We FOCUS on the colorful window curtain near the floor as it sways slightly in the breeze from the open window. We PAN UP to the bedside cabinet where a slice of cherry pie, a glass of milk, COOPER’S mini tape recorder, a lamp and a telephone reside. COOPER reaches over and picks up his mini tape recorder. Wearing only pants and the bandage around his ribs, COOPER moves the recorder to his mouth and clicks it on to record.

COOPER
Diane, its 11:05 pm, I'm in the room at the Great Northern Hotel. There's not a star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne is in custody. The trail narrows Diane. I'm very close but the last few steps are always the darkest and most difficult.

COOPER is interrupted by a KNOCK at the door. He shuts the mini tape recorder off and puts it back on the bedside cabinet. He stands up slowly, grabs a shirt and puts the shirt on as he walks towards the door. COOPER grabs his gun holster off the top of a dresser near the door and draws the revolver. He opens the door to reveal AUDREY HORNE, standing with her hands behind her back.

AUDREY
Hi.

COOPER
Audrey?

AUDREY
Can I come in and talk?

COOPER
Alright.

AUDREY notices the bandage around COOPER’S abdomen through his open shirt.

AUDREY
Ahh is that where you got shot?

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER puts his gun back in its holster.

AUDREY
Did you arrest him?

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER walks into the room and turns to face AUDREY as he buttons his shirt.

MUSIC: MYSTERIES OF LOVE

AUDREY
Did he do it?

COOPER
That’s for a court to decide.

AUDREY
What do you think?

COOPER
What I think doesn’t really matter right now.

AUDREY leans against a wall of the bedroom.

AUDREY
Did you arrest him because of what I said?

COOPER
Only in part.

AUDREY
But it helped?

COOPER
Yeah.

AUDREY
All I really wanted was for him to love me.

COOPER
I’m sure that he does.

AUDREY
He’s ashamed of me.

COOPER
No he’s not.

AUDREY climbs onto the bed and sits in the middle facing COOPER. Standing at the foot of the bed, COOPER bends over towards AUDREY.

AUDREY
Agent Cooper, when I was in One-Eyed Jacks I never, never let anyone ...

COOPER
Audrey, you don’t have to say anything.

AUDREY
I want you to know ...

COOPER
I know.

They stare at each other. The telephone RINGS. A distance apart from each other, they continue to stare at each other as the telephone RINGS again.

COOPER
I have to get that.

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY turns and kneels to face COOPER as he moves to answer the phone at the bedside stand.

COOPER turns away from AUDREY.

COOPER
How long ago? (reply) I’m on my way.

COOPER hangs the phone up and grabs his mini tape recorder.

AUDREY
What’s wrong?

COOPER
Audrey I want you to go to your room and lock the door.

COOPER bends over the bed towards AUDREY.

AUDREY
Why?

COOPER
No questions, do as I say.

AUDREY
Alright.

AUDREY quickly gets off the bed. AGENT COOPER grabs his gun holster and his coat and follows AUDREY out the door.

So now the sadness comes. The revelation. There is a depression after an answer is given. It was almost fun not knowing. Yes, now we know. At least we know what we sought in the beginning.

As the CREDITS continue to roll we PAN DOWN on an UNFOCUSED CLOSE-UP of a pine tree. The music swells as the composer’s name ‘Angelo Badalamenti’ is shown. We PAN DOWN further until we FOCUS on ALBERT’S outstretched hand holding a small plastic packet containing evidence extracted from MADELEINE, a small, bloodied paper cutout of the letter ‘O.’

ALBERT
The short answer is, this is the work of the same ghoul who killed Laura.


BACK TO SCENE:

ALBERT hands the packet to AGENT COOPER, who is standing across from him with SHERIFF TRUMAN between them by their side. COOPER holds the packet up close for a better inspection.

ALBERT
More fan mail. The letter ‘O’ under Maddy’s ring finger nail. There were strands of fur clutched in her right hand.

COOPER
What kind of fur?

ALBERT
White Fox. The strands were laced with formaldehyde, a dead animal stuffed.

TRUMAN turns to face COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’ll make the phone calls. Leland will know how to get a hold of Maddy’s family.

COOPER
Harry, don’t make any calls. I need twenty-four hours.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
For what?

COOPER
To finish this.

ALBERT has backed away from the two. He calls out for ...

ALBERT
Cooper.

ALBERT motions with a jerk of his head for COOPER to walk over to him. Face-to-face ...

ALBERT
In observation, I don’t know where this is headed ... but the only one of us with the coordinates for this destination in hardware is you. Go on whatever vision quest you require. Stand on the rim of the volcano, stand ... alone and do your dance.

ALBERT grabs a hold on COOPER’S right arm as he finishes.

ALBERT

They reach out to holds hands across the table top as the two sit across from each other.

DONNA
I thought you’d never get here.

JAMES
I went for a ride this morning. God, the engine sounded like a thousand people singing.

DONNA
What were they singing about?

JAMES
What do you think?

DONNA
Last night? I could sing about last night.

I got something for you.

JAMES pulls his hands away from their embrace with DONNA’S as he moves to his pockets to retrieve an item. JAMES places a ring case on the table top.

JAMES
Open it.

DONNA opens the ring case to expose a diamond ring. DONNA removes the ring from its case.

DONNA
Oh James.

JAMES takes the ring and DONNA holds out her hand palm down so that JAMES can slide the ring on.

JAMES
I didn’t know what size to get ... and the girl at the jewelry store had these really big hands. But I’ll bet.

JAMES slides the ring on DONNA’S finger.

JAMES
Perfect.

Before her is her mother, VIVIAN NILES, who is seated at the counter eating breakfast. VIVIAN takes a bite from her omelet and then quickly spits it back out on to her plate.

VIVIAN
From whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?

NORMA turns the blender off and turns back to face her mother.

NORMA
Are we saying we don’t like it?

VIVIAN
I’m afraid I’m going to run into a thumbtack.

NORMA
Mother, can’t you ever say anything nice? I’ve tried so hard - I’ve tried so hard and nothing is good enough for you. Let me correct myself, nothing I do is ever good enough for you.

VIVIAN grabs one of the menus from the counter.

VIVIAN
Well that’s not true. The menus are very presentable.

Angered, NORMA turns away from her.

VIVIAN
Oh I’m joking. Honestly, let me make a suggestion. If you want to serve a truly memorable omelet, try white veal sausage and morel mushrooms.

NORMA
Thanks, I’ll go pick the mushrooms.

NORMA walks off.

Seated at the island counter, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN holds a fork laden with cherry pie taken from the slice of cherry pie before him. Sitting straight and tall on his stool, ANDY stares forward and recites ...

MRS. TREMOND walks off into her house to retrieve something. DONNA turns to AGENT COOPER and says ...

DONNA
I’ve never seen her before in my life.

COOPER
I thought you delivered meals here?

DONNA turns her attention back to the door as MRS. TREMOND returns.

MRS. TREMOND
Uh the morning after poor Harold died I found this in my mail. I meant to turn it in. Its for you.

MRS. TREMOND opens the door and COOPER holds the door open as MRS. TREMOND hands the envelope to DONNA.

BACK TO SCENE:

AGENT COOPER and DEPUTY ANDY quietly stand and listen to DONNA as she continues to read from the letter.

DONNA
(gently spoken) February 23. Tonight is the night that I die. I know I have to because its the only way to keep Bob away from me. The only way to tear him out from inside. I know he wants me, I can feel his fire. But if I die he can’t hurt me anymore.

Finished, sadness starts to overcome DONNA but she fights it off with a comforting smile.

COOPER
Laura and I had the same dream.

ANDY
That’s impossible.

COOPER
(smiles) Yes it is.

COOPER walks up to ANDY.

COOPER
Deputy, take Donna home. I got to see Gerard.

COOPER walks off to the apartment complex gate. DEPUTY ANDY escorts DONNA out behind COOPER.

INT. ONE-ARMED MAN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:58)

We PAN RIGHT through the open door to the hotel bedroom where the ‘ONE-ARMED MAN’ PHILIP GERARD is being held at the Great Northern Hotel. DR. WILL HAYWARD and AGENT COOPER stand on opposite sides of the bed leaning over to the ONE-ARMED MAN. The ONE-ARMED MAN in his ‘MIKE’ state lays sitting up in the middle of the bed feverishly ill with a washcloth draped over his head as he moans and breathes heavily.

DR. HAYWARD
He’s completely dehydrated. His breathing is becoming more difficult. He needs that drug.

COOPER
Mike, Mike I need you to talk to me.

DR. HAYWARD
Any longer could kill him.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Ohh.

COOPER
Mike?

COOPER holds the left hand of the ONE-ARMED MAN. COOPER gets the ONE-ARMED MAN’S attention.

COOPER
Bob has killed again.

The ONE-ARMED MAN becomes agitated and grabs the washcloth off of his head.

COOPER
I need to know something. I need you to help me.

The ONE-ARMED MAN nods his head for yes.

COOPER
Bob was in my dream, Laura Palmer was in my dream, so were you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she died.

The ONE-ARMED MAN nods his head again.

COOPER
The same dream that I had. I need to unlock that. I need the answer that’s inside of me.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Bob and I, when we were killing together, there was this - this perfect relationship; appetite, ...

The ONE-ARMED MAN holds up a clenched fist at COOPER and sticks his thumbs up.

ONE-ARMED MAN
... satisfaction, ...

Still holding the clenched fist with his thumb up, the ONE-ARMED MAN then extends his index finger up.

ONE-ARMED MAN
... a golden circle.

The ONE-ARMED MAN then extends all his fingers to reveal an open palm to COOPER.

COOPER
A golden circle?

Grinning, the ONE-ARMED MAN moves the tip of his index finger to touch the tip of his thumb to form a circle.

COOPER
(realization) The ring. My ring. I gave my ring to the giant.

ONE-ARMED MAN
He is known to us here.

COOPER
Then he’s real?

ONE-ARMED MAN
As real as I. (laughs) He can help you find Bob.

COOPER
How?

ONE-ARMED MAN
You must ask him first.

COOPER
How do I do that?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Oh you have all the clues you need. The answer is not here my friend.

The ONE-ARMED MAN touches COOPER’S forehead.

ONE-ARMED MAN
The answer is here.

The ONE-ARMED MAN touches COOPER’S chest and then sits back slightly writhing in pain.

COOPER
I don’t understand.

ONE-ARMED MAN
So much responsibility.

The ONE-ARMED MAN writhes in pain. DR. HAYWARD looks on in confusion. Disappointed, AGENT COOPER stands up straight and then leaves the room. Laying back on a pillow, the ONE-ARMED MAN has fallen quiet as he slowly lets out a breath.

SENOR DROOLCUP
I know about you.

We PAN UP to AGENT COOPER, who is deep in thought as he stands in the middle of the office staring at the mounted white fox. DEPUTIES are moving all over the office looking for clues and evidence.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I want you to check everything in these rooms, everything.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to COOPER and holds out a document for him to see.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Coop, we found his telephone records. Look at this, the night Laura died.

TRUMAN points out the evidence on the record sheet.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The telephone call Leland told us about.

COOPER returns his attention to the white fox.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ben called her number from this office.

COOPER
White Fox.

TRUMAN looks over to the mounted white fox.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah; white, dead and stuffed. Maddy was here. I think Ben killed her in this office and then took her to the waterfall.

AGENT ALBERT walks up to COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He killed Laura and he killed Maddy.

ALBERT
Madeleine Ferguson died the night before last between 10 pm and midnight.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That fits. We didn’t take Ben in until after midnight.

ALBERT
That’s as close as I can cut it.

ALBERT hands COOPER an envelope.

ALBERT
Ben Horne’s blood test.

COOPER opens the envelope and takes a look at the results on the document inside. After viewing the results he quietly passes the envelope to SHERIFF TRUMAN and returns to staring at the white fox.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the reception area of the building just outside the coffee station, a WORKMAN stands on a ladder as he works on one of the fire sprinklers. LUCY MORAN stands besides the ladder watching and listening to him.

WORKMAN
‘Nother couple of minutes and I’ll have this baby right up to code. Tweaking the sensors mostly. Don’t want your sprinklers to be overly jumpy, gotta set it just so.

DEPUTY ANDY walks up to LUCY.

ANDY
I want to talk about my child, our baby.

LUCY
Maybe.

ANDY
Maybe what?

LUCY
Maybe it is our baby and maybe it isn’t.

The WORKMAN can’t help but overhear and peers down at the two.

ANDY
Dick? (momentarily closes his eyes) Oh my lord, is he the father?

LUCY
At first I thought you were the father but then you said you didn’t have any sperms.

The WORKMAN looks down at ANDY. ANDY meets his gaze. Embarrassed, ANDY looks away.

LUCY
Then I thought it was Dick but now you say your sperms are back. So as far as I can tell it a fifty/fifty proposition.

Quietly, ANDY walks away.

LUCY
Andy where are you going? What are you doing?

ANDY walks into LUCY reception office, picks up the phone receiver and dials a number.

LUCY
Who are you calling?

ANDY
(boldly into the phone) I want to speak to Richard Tremaine, men’s fashions. (reply) Yes I’ll hold.

LUCY
You won’t hurt him will you Andy?

LUCY’S eyes brighten with prospect of ANDY fighting over her.

ANDY
(bold) Tremaine, Brennan, Andy Brennan. We need to talk. (cowers) That is if you’re not to busy.

LUCY throws her arms down in disappointment in the change of his tone.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CELL BLOCK - DAY

In a jail cell in the basement of the building, BENJAMIN HORNE, looking like a mess in his business suit, sits on the lower bunk bed. MR. TOJAMURA enters the small basement cell block room and walks up to BENJAMIN’S jail cell. BENJAMIN looks up and notices him.

BENJAMIN
Tojamurason.

BENJAMIN stands up. TOJAMURA bows in greeting to BENJAMIN.

BENJAMIN
How nice of you to come calling.

TOJAMURA speaks with a gravely voice.

TOJAMURA
You are in prison.

BENJAMIN
Yes well ... a momentary inconvenience I assure you.

TOJAMURA holds a pen in his right hand and several documents in his left hand.

TOJAMURA
We have papers to sign.

BENJAMIN
The Ghostwood contracts. Uh Tojamurason, I’m afraid there’s uh ... there’s been a snag.

TOJAMURA
A snag?

BENJAMIN
Unforeseen difficulties, some legal in nature others uh ... I uh ... I am unable to uh sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.

TOJAMURA walks right up to the jail cell bars.

TOJAMURA
Then you will return my five million doll-ars.

BENJAMIN
Well I ... I want to return your money. I want to sign the contracts.

BENJAMIN paces around in his jail cell as he speaks.

BENJAMIN
Tojamurason, as you can see I am incarcerated. Falsely accused but uhm ... my brother, (laughs slightly) the boy genius, is out looking for a better lawyer and until justice is done, until I am able to breathe ...

BEN lightly pounds his chest.

BENJAMIN
... the air that free men breathe, I plead with you for understanding.

BENJAMIN spreads out a white handkerchief on the lower bunk bed and takes a seat.

BENJAMIN
This is the long, dark night of my soul. Time to seek that ... tiny flickering flame within.

MR. TOJAMURA removes his foot from his shoe and sticks it through the bars of BEN’S jail cell to reveal red painted toenails!?

BENJAMIN
Forgive me, I’ve been very emotional lately.

Looking down at the floor, BENJAMIN does not notice the foot right away but he does look up and sees it. With his glasses off, BENJAMIN can’t clearly make it out.

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (UPBEAT VARIANT)   32K

MR. TOJAMURA wiggles his toes. BENJAMIN quickly puts his glasses on and looks closely at the foot. BENJAMIN peers up and squints as he looks at TOJAMURA’S face.

BENJAMIN
Catherine?!

Speaking through ugly false teeth, CATHERINE MARTELL’S voice emanates from the disguise of TOJAMURA.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE
(smiling) Benjamin Horne, you’re a slimy rat bastard and I tend to make whatever remains of your pathetic existence a living hell.

BEN is astonished and holds out his arms in joy.

BENJAMIN
Oh Catherine.

BEN moves down to kneel on the floor at TOJAMURA / CATHERINE outstretched foot and kisses it.

BENJAMIN
Oh - ho, oh my god. You’ve come.

Gripping the bars of his jail cell, BEN climbs up from his crouched position to kneel up to TOJAMURA / CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
Oh Catherine, Catherine - Catherine ... tell Sheriff Truman about the night that we spent together the night that Laura was killed.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE stands quietly.

BENJAMIN
You want me to beg? You want me to beg? Because I’ll beg.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE
Will you sign Ghostwood and the Mill over to me?

BEN quickly mulls it over.

BENJAMIN
In a heartbeat.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE passes BEN a fold of documents and a pen.

BENJAMIN
Oh clever disguise Catherine, really brilliant.

BEN quickly goes through the documents and signs on the bottom line of each one.

BENJAMIN
Oh signed, sealed and de-livered.

BEN quickly folds the documents up and passes them through the bars of the cell back to TOJAMURA / CATHERINE. BEN stands up, elated.

BENJAMIN
Now you’ll tell the sheriff, huh. You’ll tell the sheriff.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE
(straight faced) I’ll consider it.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE heads towards the doorway for the cell block. BEN reaches out with his left hand.

BENJAMIN
Catherine, Catherine wait a minute. Wait a minute. Its the truth after all.

With a grin, TOJAMURA / CATHERINE turns to BEN.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE
Why Ben, we spent our entire adult lives lying to each other. Why spoil it with the truth now.

TOJAMURA / CATHERINE leaves the cell block.

BENJAMIN
Catherine!

BEN removes his handkerchief from his interior suit pocket and wipes the bars of the jail cell.

BENJAMIN

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Having just let DONNA into his house, LELAND PALMER closes the front door and walks into the living room to talk to her.

LELAND
Donna, I’m so happy you stopped by. We haven’t had the time to just sit down and talk for so long. May I get you a glass of lemonade?

DONNA is wearing a long black coat and sunglasses.

DONNA
No thanks Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute.

LELAND
Oh.

DONNA reaches into her coat pocket, pulls out an audio cassette tape and hands it to LELAND.

DONNA
Uh this is for Maddy. Its a tape of a song we did with James. I want her to have a copy.

LELAND holds the tape up to view its labeled side.

LELAND
That’s very sweet of you. She told me all about this. She said it was a very enjoyable experience.

LELAND puts the tape into his suit pocket.

DONNA
Well anyway, if you could mail it to her I’d really appreciate it.

Straight faced, LELAND stares at DONNA’S sunglasses.

LELAND
No it won’t be any problem at all.

DONNA notices LELAND’S stare.

DONNA
Is something wrong?

LELAND shakes his head for no.

LELAND
No.

He then shakes his head for yes and points at DONNA’S sunglasses.

LELAND
Uh those glasses?

DONNA
They were Laura’s. Maddy gave them to me.

LELAND
I thought they look familiar.

LELAND points at her glasses again and extends his hand as if he wanted to touch them. Uneased, LELAND quickly turns around and moves away from DONNA. DONNA reaches for and places a cigarette in her mouth. As LELAND stirs alone in thought, DONNA lights her cigarette with a lighter.

DONNA
Mr. Palmer.

Still distant, LELAND mutters an acknowledgment.

DONNA
Did you know that they found Laura’s secret diary.

LELAND
Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.

DONNA
No, not the one the police found. She had another one. I didn’t even know about did you?

Surprised by the news, LELAND’S eyes widen as he slowly turns to face DONNA.

LELAND
No.

DONNA
She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. Harold killed himself a few day ago. The police found it in his apartment.

LELAND looks aside as he mutters, wide-eyed.

LELAND
Oh my god, I had no idea.

He quickly turns back to DONNA.

DONNA
I wish I knew what was in it don’t you?

LELAND nods yes.

DONNA
I think about Laura all the time.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARL’S THEME

LELAND brandishes a small grin and moves towards DONNA. Just as LELAND stands next to and looks down at DONNA, the telephone RINGS.

LELAND
Oh excuse me.

LELAND walks to a phone near the front door and answers it.

LELAND
(into the phone) Hello. (reply) Yeah Beth, how are you? (reply) No, not since yesterday. (reply)

Overhearing the conversation over the phone, DONNA removes her sunglasses to focus on the telephone conversation.

LELAND
(into the phone) Of course Beth, I took Maddy to the bus station myself. (reply) Well I ... I’m sure there must be some perfectly reasonable explanation. (reply) Yes of course I’ll call you immediately, within the hour. Bye Beth.

LELAND hangs up the phone and turns to walk into the living room but stops in the doorway to reach into his suit jacket to remove a package of chewing gum. Cold and emotionless, LELAND stares into the living room.

DONNA
Maddy?

LELAND
(straight faced) Its the strangest thing, she never made it home.

LELAND unwraps a stick of gum.

DONNA
Oh god.

LELAND puts the stick of gum into his mouth. Worried, DONNA exhales. LELAND notices and comforts her with a smile.

LELAND
Ohh ... Donna, don’t you worry about a thing. I’ll get us some lemonade and ...

LELAND moves back into the foyer and walks up to a mirror near the doorway. LELAND uses the mirror to check and adjust his tie.

LELAND
... we’ll sit down and give it a think and we’ll work the problem out ...

We view a CLOSE-UP on LELAND’S profile as he chews his gum and adjusts his tie.

Startled, DONNA quickly spins around and pants slightly in alarm. Just as quickly as DONNA spun around, LELAND has moved to extend a glass of lemonade toward her. Panic and panting subsiding, DONNA smiles, reaches out and collects the glass of lemonade.

DONNA
I knew she was expecting us, I mean ... I guess I was selfish, I thought I could see her any time. I mean Missoula’s not that far away right?

In a supporting gesture, LELAND caress DONNA’S arms near the elbow.

LELAND
Oh Donna, you’re taking this much to much to heart. I’m sure she’s just fine.

LELAND removes his gentle hold, smiles and points at her.

LELAND
I know the cure for what ails you. Its simple really, it always makes me feel good.

An old song starts up. DONNA smiles at the pleasant tune.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the antique record player as the record spins. We slowly PAN UP to view a man in a blue jean jacket - it is BOB, standing exactly where LELAND was standing. We FOCUS on BOB’S face. Slightly shaking in a quietly growing rage, BOB scowls in clenched teeth. As the music plays on, BOB suddenly explodes in a loud cry as thunder rattles and mysterious blue lightning streaks from outside to illuminate the frightening face of BOB.

BOB slowly turns around ...


BACK TO SCENE:

LELAND turns around from the record player to face DONNA. He cascades in a dance from side-to-side as he moves over to DONNA and extends a hand.

LELAND
May we have this dance please?

DONNA smiles and extends her hand to hold his. LELAND draws her to the center of the room and clasps her other hand as they mildly dance. DONNA smiles at LELAND as he dances with his eyes closed.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP RECORD NEEDLE

As the music plays, we view a CLOSE-UP on the needle of the antique record player as the black vinyl record spins.

LELAND stares at DONNA as he holds her hands between them as they dance. DONNA looks down at LELAND’S grip on her hands and tugs slightly to remove herself from his grip.

MUSIC: WALKING IN THE DARK

LELAND looks up and towards the door and then releases his close squeeze on DONNA. DONNA pants in fear from the sudden and disturbing outburst. LELAND pats her hair and holds one of her hands, which she pulls away from him, before walking away towards the record player.

LELAND lifts the needle off of the record and puts it in its harness to stop the music.

LELAND turns to DONNA and points at her.

As LELAND walks away to answer the door, DONNA caresses herself as she calms herself down and her breathing slowly returns to normal.

LELAND opens the front door and allows SHERIFF TRUMAN into the foyer. DONNA overhears their conversation from the nearby living room.

LELAND
Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland we need your help.

LELAND
What is it?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’m afraid there’s been another murder.

LELAND
Oh my god.

DONNA
Now I can’t tell you why or how but we need your help and we need it right away.

BOBBY hops off the back of the wheelchair and spins LEO around to face the void of the interior. COOPER turns around as he speaks to everyone in the room.

COOPER
Gentlemen, two days ago a young woman was found murdered by the same individual I believe responsible for the death of Laura Palmer. I have reason to believe that the killer is in this room. As a member of the bureau I spend most of my time seeking simple answers to difficult questions. In the pursuit of Laura’s killer I have employed bureau guidelines, deductive technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I find myself in need of something new ... which for lack of a better word we shall call ... magic.

Lightning streaks and sizzles through the air outside flashing the interior with bright blue light. ALBERT looks up, a little mystified by the timing of the lighting. Everyone but BENJAMIN has listened intently.

BENJAMIN
Would you like us to hum? A Tibetan chant perhaps.

BENJAMIN laughs to himself. Seated at the bar next to SHERIFF TRUMAN, ALBERT remarks ...

ALBERT
I think its going terrifically well, (turns to TRUMAN) don’t you?

SENOR DROOLCUP quietly nods for yes. Looking at SENOR DROOLCUP, MAJOR BRIGGS motions with a head nod towards COOPER. Slowly, SENOR DROOLCUP walks towards AGENT COOPER. As he walks up to COOPER, SENOR DROOLCUP extends a package of chewing gum towards him and smiles brightly. COOPER reaches out and grabs himself a stick of gum. SENOR DROOLCUP quietly waves to him and walks off past him. Baffled, COOPER looks down at the stick of gum he holds in his hands. LELAND smiles and points at the gum as SENOR DROOLCUP moves to stand next to him.

LELAND
I know that gum. I used to chew it when I was a kid. That’s my most favorite gum in the world.

SENOR DROOLCUP
That gum you like is going to come back in style.

You’d might like to bring along Leland Palmer as your attorney.

BENJAMIN drops a handful of peanuts into the bowl as DEPUTY HAWK and SHERIFF TRUMAN arrive at his booth to escort him back to jail. BENJAMIN stands up and HAWK and TRUMAN each grab an arm which BEN resists with a tug. As they reach the door, BENJAMIN jerks the two in quiet protest. HAWK and TRUMAN get a firm grip and haul him out of the building. LELAND and AGENT ALBERT follow right behind them.

LELAND / BOB
Ah yeah, I suppose you wanna ask him some questions, huh.

Looking down at LELAND / BOB, COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Did you kill Laura Palmer?

LELAND cocks his head up and hoots ...

LELAND / BOB
WHOOO!!! WHOO-WHOO! HOO-HOO-HOO!! WHOOO!!! WHOO! HOO-HOO! WHOOO!!!

LELAND / BOB levels his head and calmly says ...

COOPER
How about Madeleine Ferguson?

LELAND / BOB
What do you think?

COOPER
I’m asking you.

LELAND / BOB
What do you think?

COOPER
Answer the question.

Shifting from an emotionless cold response to a childlike persona, LELAND / BOB rolls his head around slightly as he says ...

LELAND / BOB
Oh gosh gee-gee whiz I guess I kinda sorta did. I have this thing for knives.

LELAND / BOB grits his teeth and turns to COOPER.

COOPER
Does Leland know what you’ve done?

LELAND / BOB
Leland’s a babe in the woods ... with a large hole where his conscious used to be. (lifts his head up, wide eyed) And when I go children I will pull that rip cord and you watch Leland, remember. Watch him! But not for long.

LELAND / BOB jerks his head with a grunt once, twice and then one last time before he slowly and quietly lowers his head. LELAND / BOB falls silent.

Oh.

LUCY
That’s not open for discussion.

ANDY turns to DICK.

DICK looks at ANDY and holds up a long gold, feminine cigarette holder.

DICK
Got a light?

ANDY checks his shirt pockets and then his pants pockets before he turns to DICK and renounces ...

ANDY
No.

DICK grins at ANDY and then moves to retrieve his own lighter which he uses to light his cigarette.

DICK
(to LUCY) You were saying.

LUCY
There’s only one way to handle this. They have a test to determine the blood type of the father. (to DICK) It could be you.

DICK smiles at LUCY.

LUCY
(to ANDY) Or it could be you.

ANDY sits quietly. Holding is cigarette holder vertically, DICK turns to sneer at ANDY.

LUCY
They won’t be doing this test until after the baby is born. During which time I expect complete cooperation from each of you two gentlemen.

DICK
What ever you say Lucy. I mean it is your baby.

Just outside the door to the interrogation room, DEPUTY HAWK keeps a vigil on LELAND / BOB through the door’s window. AGENT ALBERT and SHERIFF TRUMAN stand together as they listen to AGENT COOPER.

COOPER
Ben Horne’s blood test, he’s the wrong type.

ALBERT lights himself a cigarette even though a sign painted in large red letters behind COOPER says ‘No Smoking’.

COOPER
Harry, the answer was right in front of me from the very beginning. What did the little man do in my dream?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He danced.

COOPER
After Laura’s death Leland danced compulsively. We were told that Bob the killer was a gray haired man. When Leland killed Jacques his hair turned gray overnight. Leland said when he was a child the gray haired man who lived next door was named Robertson. Mike said the people Bob inhabited were his children. Robertson, son of Robert. The letters under the finger nails ‘R’, ‘O’, ‘B’, ‘T’; Bob was spelling his name. The signature on a demon self-portrait.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why would he kill her?

COOPER
Laura was writing about Bob in her diary. Leland found it, ripped out the pages. She knew he was on to her. It was Leland who placed that call from Ben Horne’s office to Laura the night she died. He was the third man outside Jacques cabin window. He took the girls to the train car. It was his blood we found not Ben Horne’s.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Then why kill Maddy?

COOPER
Maybe she reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home perhaps he couldn’t bear to part with her. He wanted to relive the experience or maybe she realized Bob was the killer and he found out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now this Bob ... he can’t really exist, I mean, Leland is just crazy right?

I was just a boy. I saw him in my dreams. He said he - he wanted to play. He opened me and I invited him and he came inside me.

COOPER
He went inside?

LELAND
When he was inside, I didn’t know and when he was gone I couldn’t remember. He made me do things, terrible things. He said he wanted lives, he wanted others. Others that they could use like they used me.

COOPER
Like Laura?

LELAND
They wanted her. They wanted Laura ... but she was strong. She fought ‘em. She wouldn’t let them in. Oh god, they had me kill that girl Teresa. (strains in pain) And they ... and they said ... and if I didn’t give them Laura they’d have me kill her too.

COOPER
But she wouldn’t let them in?

LELAND
She said she die ... before she let ‘em. And then they made me kill her. Oh god have mercy on me. What have I done. What have I done. Oh god, I love her. I love her with all my heart. My angel forgive me.

COOPER turns to ALBERT, a questioning gaze about LELAND’S condition. ALBERT shakes his head as a reply, It’s not good. ALBERT can’t do anything to help LELAND. Frustrated, ALBERT stands up and leans on the wall. SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up and moves next to ALBERT. COOPER turns back to LELAND.

Leland the time has come for you to seek the path. Your soul has set you face to face with the clear light and you are now about to experience it in its reality. Where in all things are like the void and cloudless sky and the naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum without circumference or center.

SHERIFF TRUMAN takes a seat on the pine needle carpeted ground against a pine tree. ALBERT and COOPER lean up against pine trees.

Gentlemen, there’s more in heaven and Earth than what’s dreamt up in our philosophy.

Amen.

Well I lived in these old woods most of my life. I’ve seen some strange things but this is way off the map, I’m having a hard time ... believing.

No.

COOPER
Yes, because its our job to stop it.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yeah.

MAJOR BRIGGS walks off down the path.

Maybe that’s all Bob is. The evil that men do. Maybe it doesn’t matter what we call it.

No, Doc, I don't want it. I want to be there. Every

Today I bury my husband. Next to my only child. Her
grave is still fresh. There's just a little bit of grass on it.

She stops, numb with grief. Cooper leans in.

COOPER
Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this
world. Things too horrible to tell our children. Your
husband fell victim to one of them. Long ago, when he
was innocent and trusting. Leland didn't commit these
crimes. Not the Leland you knew.

SARAH

He's gone. Forever.

So is everything dear to me.

COOPER
Laura and Leland have gone from this life to the next. But
they're with you always. Here ... and here ...

Those moments are yours. Always.

You're just jealous.

Hey now, c'mon you two, knock it off.

Extraordinary display.

They've had a running feud for about fifty years.

Nobody knows how it started. Something about an old
flame and a rumble seat. I'm not even sure they
remember anymore.

The nest's a little stirred up right now. Dougie's engaged
to be married. To a babe.

Remember the first time Dwayne ran for mayor ... when

Uh, sixty-two, 1962.

DOC
Dougie wrote an editorial, came out against Dwayne.
And Dwayne was running unopposed.

PETE
Dwayne was dog catcher at the time. So he let all the
dogs from the pound loose in Dougie's house.

Ernie wants to see wilderness. You know a better way?
You girls mind the home front now.

He takes Ernie's arm and pulls him back out the door - as Ernie waves good-bye to Vivian. Vivian turns to Norma.

VIVIAN
Henry seems unusually fond of my Ernie.

NORMA
Hank says it's like they've known each other in a past life.
(a beat of silence)
It gives me a weird feeling

VIVIAN
Hank's always given you a weird feeling.

10. INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Administrative office. VICE-PRINCIPAL GREEGE sits behind his desk, in conference with Ed Hurley and Dr. Jacoby.

GREEGE
I want to be crystal clear about this. Your asking me to
admit a thirty-five year old woman to the senior class?

JACOBY
Strictly for medical reasons.

GREEGE
(glances at the file)
Well, she never did actually graduate. As I recall, she
left school to marry you, Ed.

ED
You got me there.

We HEAR SOME VOICES outside and Nadine bursts in the door, wearing a little pleated skirt, puffy-sleeved blouse, tennis shoes and socks, hair in a ponytail - deep in teen-land.

NADINE
Eddie, how much longer? Class is starting!

ED
We'll be right out, Nadine. Just a few more minutes.

NADINE
Guess what - cheerleading tryouts tomorrow! I saw it on
the bulletin board -

ED
(ushering her out)
That's great, honey. Why don't you practice your splits?

He shuts the door, and sits back down. Greege tries to recover ...

GREEGE
She's certainly trying to recapture that old school spirit.

JACOBY
A classic case of clinical regression. Mr. Greege, what's
important here is that Nadine be allowed to maintain her
own reality. Being eighteen is all she can manage. And it
could be a lot worse. Be glad she's not napping in a crib.

Ed shudders. Greege reaches his decision.

GREEGE
We will admit her under one condition: she has to
perform like a regular student. Ed, my advice to you is
can forget hot dinners. Nadine'll be busy doing her
homework like every other senior.

Ed nods. Grimaces. Another body blow.

11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - DAY

FISHING GEAR is arrayed against one wall: rod 'n reel, net, waders, etc. COOPER'S wearing a FISHING VEST while he packs. A black Samsonite is open on the bed - white shirts stacked inside. He softly hums. The door is open behind him. He hears a knock.

COOPER
(without turning)
Bellman?

AUDREY
(entering, good-humored)
Customer relations. Has everything been satisfactory for
you during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?

COOPER
Aside from the ugly shooting incident, no complaints.

AUDREY
(re: suitcase)
When are you leaving?

COOPER
I'm going fishing.

AUDREY
You're leaving.

COOPER
Audrey, I ... in effect I am leaving, yes.

AUDREY
(trying to sound devil may care)
So this is it? You save my life, then break my heart.

COOPER
Audrey I've explained to you my personal policy of not
getting involved with women who -

AUDREY
I know, I know. I'm a teenager.

COOPER
And you were involved in a case I was working on.

AUDREY
Someone must have hurt you once. Very badly.

COOPER
No. Someone was hurt by me. And I will never let that
happen again.

AUDREY
(being light)
What happened, did they die or something?

COOPER
As a matter of fact she did. Would you like to know how?
(after a beat, she looks away; trying to shock)
She was a material witness to a federal crime. We were
supposed to protect her. Twenty-four hours a day.
Myself and my partner, the man who taught me
everything I know about being a special agent. I fell in
love with her. And when the attempt on her life was
finally made I wasn't ready. Because I loved her. She
died in my arms. I was badly wounded. And my
partner, Windom Earle was his name, lost his mind. Do
you need me to be more specific?

Audrey, chastened and horrified, shakes her head.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
I like you, Audrey and I care for you. I'll always
consider you my friend.

AUDREY
(quoting him)
Friendship is the foundation of any lasting relationship.

COOPER
It's nice to be quoted accurately.

AUDREY
Well let me tell you something, Agent Cooper; one of
these days, before you know it, I'll be grown-up and on
my own. And you just better watch out.

COOPER
(likes the idea)
Okay Audrey. It's a deal.

With as much dignity as she can muster, she walks to the door, opens it and turns back to him.

AUDREY
There's only one problem with you. You're perfect.

She slips out, closing the door. Cooper sits down hard on the bed.

COOPER
Sometimes it's a burden.

12. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE ON BOBBY'S REFLECTION in a MIRROR, trying on a shiny, blue sharkskin suit - a little baggy. We PULL BACK to reveal the mirror is propped up in LEO'S LAP. Several TIES are draped over one of Leo's arms, and a SHIRT hangs from the back of his head.

BOBBY
It's big - but it's bad.

He looks over at Shelly, wearing sweatpants and a man's shirt - tired and depressed.

SHELLY
Leo just got that suit. Fits him a little tighter.

BOBBY
Well it's a shame to let good threads go to waste.
(grabs a BLUE TIE off Leo's arm)
What do ya think- blue or green? I gotta look good. Ben
Horne's a man who notices these things.

SHELLY
You look great. Bobby, take me out tonight. I'll get all
dressed up -

BOBBY
What about the Leo?

SHELLY
I'll get a sitter! Bobby, please, I've got to get out of
here. I'm going crazy!

BOBBY
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me. If I land this "job" with
Mr. Horne, we're on easy street. I'll take care of you in
ways you never dreamed of. Hang in there, and let
Bobby do his thing.
(taking her in his arms)
It's for us, baby.

Over her shoulder, Bobby winks at Leo. He then he kisses her - long and deep. Shelly melts.

BOBBY
Okay?

She nods, placated. Bobby breaks away.

BOBBY (continued)
I gotta ramble. So which is it: blue or green?

Leo GURGLES.

BOBBY (continued)
He likes the green. My man Leo.
(grabs the green tie and heads for the door)
Doll face, cross your fingers, cross your toes. This is the
big time.

The door slams. We HOLD ON Shelly's face, abandoned. She looks over at Leo, holding the mirror, a human valet - and starts to cry.

13. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CATHERINE MARTELL stands, looking out a window. Truman walks in carrying a cup of coffee and a small PAPER SACK. Truman sees her, stops short. Nearly drops his coffee.

CATHERINE
Hello, Harry.

TRUMAN
Forgive my saying so, Catherine. But you're dead.

Catherine shrugs, enjoying his consternation.

TRUMAN
Does Pete know?

CATHERINE
My husband and I have been duly reunited.

TRUMAN
(figuring)
Well, all things considered... Welcome home.

CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Any questions?

TRUMAN
(shifting gears, more business-like)
A couple.

CATHERINE
Am I under suspicion?

TRUMAN
I guess that depends on the answers I get. Maybe you'd
like to call your lawyer.

CATHERINE
That won't be necessary. I have nothing to hide.

TRUMAN
Good. For starters, where the hell have you been the past
two weeks?

CATHERINE
Do you believe in guardian angels, Harry?

TRUMAN
Angels? To tell the truth, I'm not so sure what I believe
in anymore.

CATHERINE
(voice gathering emotion)
I believe an angel saved my life.

That gets his attention. Catherine braces herself.

CATHERINE
I was at home the night of the fire. A man called, a
voice I didn't recognize. He told me to meet him at the
drying shed. A vague threat was implied. So I went
there. I took a gun. That girl, what was her name?

TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson.

CATHERINE
(a memory steeped in melodrama)
She was tied up inside. A bomb went off. The rest is
just impressions, walls of fire crashing, screams. I have
no idea how I escaped. I came to in the woods. Afraid
for my life. More afraid than I've ever been. I dragged
myself through the dark for what seemed like forever,
not even sure if I was dead or alive. As the sky
lightened, things began to look familiar. The woods. A
path. A rock formation. I was flooded with memories
of my childhood. And I thought, well, this is what
heaven is. That's when I saw our old summer cabin in the
distance. I'd walked twenty miles through the night.
Heaven was Pearl Lakes. And only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.

Catherine pauses to wipe the tears from her eyes. Truman leans to grab a box of tissues. Occupied, he doesn't see the brief sneer pass across Catherine's features.

CATHERINE
(taking a tissue)
Thank you.
(resuming her artful tale of woe)
We always kept a well-stocked pantry. I went in and
opened a can of tuna fish. And I waited for whoever it
was who had tried to kill me to come and finish the job.
No phone, no newspaper, no television. I tended my
wounds, a loaded gun at my side, terrified that each
moment might be my last.

TRUMAN
(swept away in spite of himself)
Why did you come back?

CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I ran out of tuna fish.

A little bit of the old Catherine bleeds through. Sarcasm and superiority. Truman takes a closer look. Wonders just what she's really thinking. Where she's really been.

CUT TO:


14. INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Catherine walks out, just as RICHARD TREMAYNE walks in. He makes a beeline for Lucy.

TREMAYNE
(beaming)
My dove; great news - I've quit smoking!

LUCY
What are you doing here?

TREMAYNE
I wanted to see you. I wanted - to be honest, I wanted to
talk about our bambino.

LUCY
Our bambino?

TREMAYNE
Lucy, I've been in a gnarly turmoil and do you know
what I've discovered? I, Dick Treymayne, am a terrible,
crashing bore. And what I desperately require in my life
is something, no, someone more important than myself to
think about, to care for. So perhaps you see why that
as a result, I must say, parenthood suddenly appeals to me.

LUCY
Parenthood?

TREMAYNE
Fatherhood, more specifically. And since I have no skills
in this area, nurturing is a relatively foreign concept, I've
enlisted myself in the "Happy Helping Hand" program;
part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.

LUCY
Excuse me, are you the Dick Treymayne who works at
Horne's department store?

HAWK walks through reception, glaring at Tremayne.

TREMAYNE
Yes. And, Lucy, by the way, I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.

Hawk makes a face, sickened. He rounds the corner, and runs smack into DEPUTY ANDY, who's been listening to all of this. Hawk reacts, but Andy sshushes him. Andy steps into the lobby, confronting Tremayne and Lucy.

ANDY
Lucy, Dick, I have something, I'd like to say.
(pauses, takes a deep breath, nothing comes out)

LUCY
Andy, what is it?

ANDY
I would like to say that we're all in a very difficult
position. I come from a large family. And Mama
always said she couldn't have fussin' and fightin' around
her when she had a bun in the oven. And until we know for
sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball, or building
that doll house we should all be friends.
(extends his hand to a very stunned Tremayne
who finally shakes it - wet noodle style)
So you two go right talk, and I'll see ya.

Lucy and Treymayne stare at each other. Andy backs out of reception and into the hall - practically collapsing into Hawk's arms.

HAWK
(hissing whisper)
Andy are you crazy?

ANDY
Hawk, I know Lucy, and I know what'll get her. M orals
and manly behavior.
(pause, an unmanly moment of doubt)
You think I went too far?

They straighten up as Cooper enters past them, carrying fishing gear and goes into Truman's office.

15. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE

Truman's making some notes, when Cooper walks in. Truman stands up, smiling.

COOPER
Harry, I guess this is goodbye. There's a frying pan full
of steelhead trout out there with my name on 'em.

TRUMAN
That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.

Truman picks the PAPER BAG off his desk, and hands it to Cooper; awkward with the emotion he's feeling. Delighted, Cooper reaches into the bag and pulls out an intricately tied FISHING FLY - the brightly colored feathers and tinsel, with streamers hanging down.

COOPER
It's incredible.

TRUMAN
When those steelhead are running upstream, they're only
thinking about one thing. Sex. A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.

COOPER
(riveted - holding the fly up, admiring it)
A Green Butt Skunk.

TRUMAN
Tied it myself. My dad taught me how, and his dad
taught him ...

COOPER
(touched)
I don't know what to say ...

TRUMAN
(points to the bag)
There's one more thing.

Cooper reaches in and pulls out a TINY PACKAGE, wrapped in tissue. He opens it, revealing a small round badge, like a Boy Scout merit badge; an embroidered DOUGLAS FIR TREE, with a SWORD in its center.

TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys Patch. We all carry it. I talked to
everybody. We feel you're one of us now.

COOPER
Harry, I'm honored beyond any ability I might have to
express myself.

TRUMAN
You wear that ... you ever need us, we'll be there.

Harry extends his hand, Cooper grips it. A pact.

16. INT: SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA

Truman and Cooper walk into the reception area: Hawk, Andy and Lucy are lined up. Like troops ready for review. Cooper stops, looking at them. Hawk sticks out his hand.

COOPER
(shaking his hand)
Hawk. If I'm ever lost, I hope you're the man they send
to find me.

HAWK
May the wind be always at your back.

Cooper moves on to Andy, who's almost in tears.

COOPER
Deputy Andy, your bravery is exceeded only by the size
of your heart. A rare combination indeed.

They shake hands. Andy's too moved to speak. Cooper moves on to Lucy.

COOPER
Lucy, I wish you, and yours, the very best. And I hope
you'll invite me to the wedding, whoever it might be.

They embrace. She sniffles. The front doors fly open and PRESTON KING, a black Canadian Mountie in full, red uniform marches in. With him is a man who dresses just like Cooper, SPECIAL AGENT ROGER HARDY.

MOUNTIE
Sheriff Truman?

TRUMAN
Yes?

MOUNTIE
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy of the FBI -

COOPER

Hello, Roger, what are you doing here?

HARDY

TRUMAN (interrupting)
I don't.

COOPER
(to Truman, re: Hardy)
Internal Affairs.

HARDY
We're the agents who watch the agents.

COOPER
(then to Hardy, re: Mountie)
And his presence refers to my crossing into Canada?

TRUMAN
Now wait a minute, that was directly related to the case
we were investigating.

MOUNTIE
Not without my knowing about it it wasn't.

COOPER
What's the charge, Roger - misfeasance?

Roger nods, serious.

TRUMAN
Mis-what?

COOPER
The improper and unlawful execution of an act that, in
itself, is lawful and proper. The rescue of Audrey Horne.

HARDY
In part. There are also disturbing allegations as to your
motives and your methods.

TRUMAN
What allegations?

HARDY
I'm waiting for some evidence to arrive. We'll convene in
one hour.

The Secretary rolls her eyes, and goes back inside. Bobby fumes, now pacing, manic. He doesn't notice Audrey watching him.

AUDREY
A little late for Halloween isn't it?

BOBBY
What?

AUDREY
What are you supposed to be, a lounge lizard?

BOBBY
Shouldn't you be in school?

AUDREY
School numbs my butt. Shouldn't you be?

BOBBY
I'm trying to get an appointment with your father.

AUDREY
What on earth do you want to talk to him about?

BOBBY
A job - business. It's personal.

AUDREY
I didn't know daddy dearest was hiring

BOBBY
He will be - I Just need to talk to him first.

AUDREY
(intrigued)
You're up to something, Bobby Briggs. But I'm sure that's
none of my business. Count to ten.

She disappears into her father's office. Bobby's confused but counts anyway.

BOBBY
One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ...

19. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

Opera plays on a boom box. Looking slightly disheveled, Ben sits, stocking feet up on the desk, drinking a milkshake and playing with a weird electronic toy. He doesn't look up.

BOBBY
(business-like demeanor)
Mr. Horne, I know you're a busy man and I respect that
and so I'll get right to the point -

BEN
I suppose you're here to ask me for Audrey's hand in
marraige or some similar adolescent befuddlement

BOBBY
No.

BEN
(looks at him for the first time)
Well, what then?

Bobby sees the ENVELOPE he mailed Ben, laying unopened on the desk. Bobby picks it up, rips the seal, and takes out a CASSETTE TAPE.

BEN (CONTINUED)
I already have somebody to open my mail, kid.

BOBBY
Don't worry; it's from me. This'll just take a second.
Bear with me here, Mr. Horne ...

Bobby nervously tries to fumble the tape into the boom box on Ben's desk. Ben calls on his intercom.

BEN

There's a "bug" in my office.

20. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALL/LOBBY - DAY

Two HOUSE SECURITY MEN escort Bobby out of the hotel. He's been roughed up. In the lobby, Audrey looks over and sees Bobby pass by, flanked by the thugs.

AUDREY

of mine being treated like this. I may have to speak to
Father about this.

Her eyes shoot daggers. They're afraid of her. They let go of Bobby.

AUDREY (Cont'd)
Run along, boys.

The Thugs move off.

BOBBY

And you can tell your boss that tape's not the original.

Audrey clocks this last bit of info. She and Bobby walk away, arm-in-arm.

AUDREY
I can't imagine what all this was about.

BOBBY
Audrey, that's twice you've saved my bacon. We could be
talking sainthood. Anything I can do for you?

21. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The VIDEOTAPE of Cooper, recorded at One-Eyed Jack's, plays on the TV MONITOR Hardy and the Mountie sit on one side of the table, Cooper sits on the other.

HARDY
What was the purpose of your first visit to One-Eyed
Jack's?

COOPER
To gather information about the murder of Laura Palmer,
from, this man, Jacques Renault.

HARDY
Who you apparently lured back across the border, where
he was wounded during arrest and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.

COOPER
Renault was a material witness to Laura's murder. Leland
Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he
commited to prevent Renault from ever testifying against
him. Are you judging me responsibile for that?

Coooper looks at the Mountie. He takes TWO PHOTOGRAPHS out of a manilla envelope and tosses them in the middle of the table: one of BLACKIE'S DEAD BODY, the other of DEAD EMORY BATTIS.

MOUNTIE
Let's talk about your second visit ...

COOPER
To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.

MOUNTIE
Who both ended up dead.

Hardy gives Mountie a look - he'll handle this.

HARDY
You know procedure. Crossing the border without
contacting Canadian authorities is a serious breach.
Under any circumstances.

COOPER
I'm not disputing that. Is it the Bureau's position I'm
responsibile for these deaths?

HARDY
That's what we're trying to determine. This entire
matter has been brought to our attention because Mountie
King was in the middle of a sting operation to nail this
man, Jean Renault.

A photograph of Jean Renault is displayed.

MOUNTIE
We worked six months to set this up; one night you march
in, Renault escapes, these two are dead and the cocaine we
were using to set him up is stolen from the premises.

COOPER
I don't know anything about cocaine. But you've
miscounted; three people were killed., Jean Renault
killed Blackie, I didn't know until now about the Battis
murder. And a bodyguard who turned his gun on me was
killed in self-defense.

Hardy looks at the Mountie - who's been thrown by this.

HARDY
So we've got crossing jurisdictional borders, three dead
bodies and international trafficking of drugs.

COOPER
Roger, I admit to the border crossing. You already know
the extent of my involvement with the killings. I hope
you know me better than to suspect I'd have any part of a
drug transaction.

HARDY
(eyes boring holes)
I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper. I will tell
you DEA's been called in to investigate. And you've got
twenty-four hours to assemble your defense; in the
meantime I'll require that you surrender your gun and
badge.

Pause. Cooper removes his GUN from the shoulder holster, and lays it on the table. From his shirt pocket he produces the case containing his BADGE, places it next to his gun. Hardy nods to the Mountie; he opens the door, summons Truman in, who's waiting just outside. Truman sees Cooper's badge and gun. Cooper stands, smiles at Harry. He walks out, head high.

HARDY
(motioning to a chair)
Sheriff, I'll need to ask you a few questions.

TRUMAN
I'll stand.

HARDY
Let me begin by saying that whatever Agent Cooper is
guilty of will not be held against you; your cooperation
will be very useful - and greatly appreciated by the FBI.

TRUMAN
If I understand the law correctly, you (to Mountie)
need extradition papers in order to get a statement from
me. And you (to Hardy) need a subpeona from a judge.
Unless either of you have the appropriate paperwork -
you can take my cooperation and stuff It.

HARDY
That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper -

TRUMAN
It's not an attitude, it's a promise. I've had nothing, but
respect for the FBI since the day Cooper walked into my
office. He's the finest law man I've ever known; check
that, the finest man period. I don't know what
information you have or where you got it from, but I can
tell you this ... it's dead wrong

Truman turns on his heels and walks out.

TWO WRESTLERS work out in another corner of the gym, under the WRESTLING COACH'S supervision.

The Cheering Girl finishes off with a big jump in the air, touching both toes. The Pep Squad applauds. Nadine is waved forward and eagerly approaches the JUDGES' TABLE.

Greege nods to the P.E. Teacher, who, trying to act normal, writes this down.

P.E. TEACHER
I'll need your permission slip, please, Nadine.

NADINE

Permission?

P.E. TEACHER

Oh. My parents are in Europe.

TWO GIRLS in the line snicker. Greege intervenes.

GREEGE
She's okay. I've spoken. to her hus - to her guardian.

Nadine brightens.

P.E. TEACHER
Alright, Nadine, let's start you off with tumbling

Nadine bounces over to center stage. A MALE CHEERLEADER stands by to spot her. He rolls his eyes - condescending. Nadine, grinning ear-to-ear, walks backwards. Further and further, as if this were her routine. We HEAR a few laughs.

With a little jump, she starts running forward, and does a FRONT FLIP, followed by another FRONT DOUBLE FLIP, into a series of CARTWHEELS, landing right in front or the aghast MALE CHEERLEADER. She picks him up by his waist and tosses him into the air.

NADINE
Corkscrew!

And he indeed SPINS through the air, across the gym, landing on the matt on top of the wrestlers. The Coach looks from the hapless cheerleader over to Nadine - very impressed.

Nadine beams proudly, barely out of breach.

Well that's just great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so
well. This must've been the longest meeting, in history.

CAMERA MOVES down, shooting Shelly through the spokes of Leo's wheelchair.

SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Yes, I still love you. Bobby, I've been thinking, we're
really gonna have to put Leo somewhere - in a home.

The wheel of Leo's chair turns one full revolution, rolling slowly through the frame, and stops.

SHELLY (CONTINUED)
It's not worth it. I don't want the money. I want a life.

Shelly turns and starts to sit; stops, looking at Leo. Something's wrong, but she can't place it.

SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Bobby, I think he moved. I swear, Leo moved.

Okay, maybe I am losing my mind. That's what I've
been trying to tell you. Get over here tomorrow, first
thing. Please. Bye, lover.

Shelly hangs up, and goes over to Leo - the foam still hanging from his mouth - looking quite mad. Shelly looks at where she thought the chair was, and where it is now. Could it be? She shakes her head. A long day. Shelly moves around in front of Leo, peering cautiously into his eyes.

Nothing. Shelly turns away, reaching for a towel. As Leo BLOWS A BUBBLE.

TRUMAN
Who are you playing, with?

COOPER
Windom Earle. A formidable opponent.

Cooper moves his pawn, then writes his move down on a piece of paper. He puts the note in an ENVELOPE, already addressed to Windom Earle, Personals Dept., USA TODAY.

TRUMAN
I've been looking all over for you.

COOPER
I went to the library. Took a walk. I got hungry.

TRUMAN
What was at the library?

COOPER
William O. Douglas. A man from this neck of the
woods, and one of the great ministers of justice. I was
seeking, inspiration and I found it there.

TRUMAN
Preparing your defense?

COOPER
Yes. Douglas said in times of trouble a man should
immerse himself in wilderness. I'm going fishing.
(rises, lays his money on the counter)
You know, Harry, somewhere between William
Douglas and the Dalai Lama lies the perfect man.

Their attention is drawn to Norma, angrily folding up all the tableclothes and dumping them in a box behind the counter.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Norma appears to be quite upset this evening.

TRUMAN
That damn food critic finally wrote a review. Ran this
afternoon in the Seattle paper.

COOPER

Norma? You know what they say? A critic is a legless
man who teaching running.

NORMA
(devastated)
Did you read it?

COOPER
It doesn't matter; you couldn't keep people out of here if
you tried.

NORMA
You're very nice, to say so. Thanks.
(as Cooper and Truman head for the door)
Harry, is it hunting season?

TRUMAN
Not unless they've switched months on the calender.

Norma chews that over. Cooper and Truman exit.

COOPER
Harry, it's time to put that Green Butt Skunk to work.

They exit, passing Vivian just entering. She moves to Norma at the cash register.

VIVIAN
What's happened to the tablecloths?

NORMA
The critic has spoken. I feel like a fool.

VIVIAN
Darling, pick your lower lip up off the floor. It wasn't
that bad.

NORMA
Mother, don't tell me how to feel. This business is all I
have. I just want to keep my regular customers. I don't
care if anyone else ever comes here again. And they won't;
not after "if you're looking for local color stop in, but for
good food - give this one a wide berth."

VIVIAN
It said "local charm," not color.

NORMA
What did you do, memorize the piece of crash?

VIVIAN
No. I wrote it.

Pause.

VIVIAN (CONTINUED)
You might as well know so we can get this particular
melodrama over with. M. T. Wentz, c'est moi.

NORMA
I can't belive it. Is that why you came to visit. To run
me into the ground?

VIVIAN
Norma, darling, I wanted to write a good review, but it's
just not a good restaurant. I can't violate my professional
ethics -

NORMA
Ethics? I'm your daughter -

VIVIAN
Some standards have to prevail over -

NORMA
What about standards for common decency? Kindness?
Or don't those fall within the standards of your
"profession" -

VIVIAN
Of course they do -

NORMA
No, the proof's in the pudding. Even if you find it
inedible. I wouldn't treat a dog like this, much less my
own daughter.

VIVIAN
As usual, you're over-reacting -

NORMA
Am I? Maybe I am. But it's my reaction. I'm the one
who's hurt here and how I react is none of your damn
business -

VIVIAN
Dear, be sensible -

NORMA
I am being sensible. Leave this place, now and get out of
my life. I 'm not going to lei you hurt me anymore.

VIVIAN
Norma -

NORMA
Goodbye. Go.

She stares at her. Vivian grows cold and leaves. Norma pours herself a cup of coffee. Tears fall, her hands shake, rattling the cup but she knows she turned a corner.

25. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Hank and Ernie, still in hunting attire with rifles, are escorted in by a couple of PICK-UPS.

HANK
(giving the girls some chips)
Thanks, kids. We'll take it from here.
(the girls smooch them and exit)
Bagged our limit today, Ern, without firing a shot.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.

ERNIE
I'll remind you I'm a married man. Recently married.

HANK
To an extremely wealthy woman. And as we discussed
we're real eager to get into business with you -

ERNIE
I will not steal my wife's money!

HANK
Stealing? Who said anything about stealing? You're the
computer whiz, old buddy, hit the keyboard, she won't
even see a ripple in the pond. Look at it this way, Ernie,
if you don't help us, how long do you think she's going to
be your wife?
(Hank has him in half-serious headlock)
Vivian will throw you out of the house, then my partner
will kill you. So I suggest you get with the program,
pal.

Jean enters silently. He looks at Ernie, not liking what he sees.

JEAN
This is him?

HANK
(turning to present Ernie)
Ernie, meet Jean Renault. Met him in the woods one
night when he stuck a gun in my ear. Lucky for me I had
my state prosecutor's badge with me. Don't leave home
without it.
(Ernie pales, this isn't funny)
Jean, this is the Professor. What he can do with numbers
could make a thousand dollar hooker blush like a nun.

JEAN
(to Ernie, laying it out)
A recent investment opportunity fell through, leaving us
in a cash-poor position. We need $125,000. Immediately.

ERNIE
(realizing the fix he's in; lying)
I understand completely.

JEAN
Do you, Professor?

ERNIE
(inspired lying)
This, this will not be difficult. Just so you know a little
bit more about me, I've been associated with a number
of the most prestigious financial institutions in the
country; I've laundered massive amounts of money, I've
brokered tremendously large deals for the Columbian
and Bolivian industries. In other words, I'm wired in.
Hard-wired I'm your man. Definitely. Definitely your
man.

JEAN
(cheering up)
You said the magic words.

Jean turns around and walks out. Ernie looks at Hank - is this it, I'm a goner?

HANK
Nicely done, Ernie. Are you making this up?

ERNIE
(of course he is)
No, no, no, no.

Jean returns, bringing with him Sergeant King, the Mountie, now in civilian dress. He carries a briefcase.

JEAN
(to Mountie, re: Ernie)
The Professor. Our new broker.

The Mountie lays out his briefcase, opens it, revealing multiple KILOS of COCAINE. Ernie's eyes bug out. Hank pats him on the back.

HANK
You can handle this puny little load, can't you Ernie?

JEAN
(showing the pistol in his belt)
He'll take care of it for us - won't you Professor?

ERNIE
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

JEAN
Hank, take the Professor down to the tables. I understand
you have quite a system; roulette, craps. Very scientific.

ERNIE
I did, I used to, I don't, I don't gamble anymore.

JEAN
We're all gamblers here, Professor. Enjoy life.

A nod to Hank, who quickly ushers Ernie out.

MOUNTIE
I don't like the look of him.

JEAN
We'll see, won't we?
(removing one kilo)
Four for us, one to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.

MOUNTIE
(taking the key)
I'll call you when it's done.

JEAN
Where will you put it?

MOUNTIE
His car. We won't need much. A trace.

JEAN
I want him crucified.

The Mountie nods. Exits. Stay on jean.

27. INT. HARRY TRUMAN'S - NIGHT

A SOUND outside. Truman sits bolt up right in bed. He listens. Hears footsteps. He takes his pistol from the holster hanging on the headboard, moves cautiously towards the door in the darkness. He sees a shadow of movement outside the window against a curtain. Then a rattle at the door, someone trying the handle.

Hefting the gun, Truman moves to the door, stands to the side, then pulls the door open inwards. JOSIE PACKARD falls into the room, into his arms. She's exhausted, faint, a wound on her forehead.

TRUMAN
Josie ...

JOSIE
Help me ...

She slips into unconsciousness. He holds her.

13. EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Surrounded by towering Douglas Firs, Cooper and Major Briggs sit by their campfire - putting MARSHMALLOWS on sticks. FISHING GEAR dries against a tree. The remains of their dinner, TROUT BONES and HEADS, lay on tin plates.

COOPER
Major this is a fascinating concept. The other side of
love is not hate - but fear?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Absolutely. And fear is the absence of love.

COOPER
For yourself as well.

MAJOR BRIGGS
All perceptions or conditions must begin with the self.

They put their marshmallows over the fire.

COOPER
So when I let fear into my life, I'm not loving myself.

MAJOR BRIGGS
You are in direct contradiction to a state of loving
acceptance; incapable of it. Direct denial.

COOPER
Major Briggs, if I may ask a personal question ... do you
love yourself?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Very much.

Cooper's fascinated. He rotates his marshmallow in the fire.

COOPER
Then it stands to reason that Leland Palmer didn't.

MAJOR BRIGGS
One could draw that conclusion. There are powerful
forces of evil in the world. It is some men's fate to
confront great darkness. We each choose how to react. If
the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.

Cooper looks around, at the literal darkness surrounding him.

COOPER
Tomorrow I face my own demons, Major Briggs. But,
thanks to you, I believe I will do so without fear. I
carefully considered my actions before proceeding. I
went forward. I must accept the consequences.

MAJOR BRIGGS
You can do no more.

An owl hoots somewhere in the woods. They look for it. A reflective pause.

COOPER
Major, I think about "Bob." If he truly exists.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have pondered the some question continuously since this
horror was revealed to us.

COOPER
I try to imagine him, "it", out there somewhere, lurking.
Searching for prey. Terrible.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes. But remember, we have a choice; to think about it in
that way, to fear it, imparts power to evil. There are ways
to resist. You, Sir, are blessed with certain gifts. In this
respect you are not alone. Have you ever heard of the
White Lodge?

COOPER
(takes a bite of marshmellow)
The White Lodge. No.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Excuse me, mine is now seared to perfection.

Briggs pops the whole blackened marshmallow into his mouth. Cooper rises.

COOPER
I'll be right back, Major. Call of nature. There's nothing
quite like urinating in the open air. I look forward to
hearing about the White Lodge.

The Major, his mouth full, gives a "thumbs up."

CUT TO:


29. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Cooper moves behind a tree to urinate. An OWL SCREECHES.

ON THE TREE BRANCHES above him, two luminous EYES shine out of the darkness.

Cooper heads back to camp. There's another OWL SCREECH - much louder, more chilling. And between him and campsite, a flash of WHITE LIGHT.

INTERCUT:


30. MAJOR BRIGGS

Looking into the white light - surrounding a TALL, DARK, CLOAKED FIGURE, face obscured by a cowled hood.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Cooper!

Cooper hurries back to camp, fighting fear with every step.

COOPER
Major? Major Briggs?

He stops. A new marshmallow is on Briggs' stick, laying in the fire. The MARSHMALLOW IGNITES. Briggs is gone. Cooper looks up, past the fire, toward the white light that first drew the Major's attention.

COOPER
MAJOR?

Cooper runs toward the light, up a dark hill. But as he nears it, the light suddenly goes out. HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.

3. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE

ANGLE ON MRS. BRIGGS, sitting in a chair facing TRUMAN and COOPER.

MRS. BRIGGS
I don't want to alarm you overly. Garland has
disappeared before. Granted it's always been work
related. Agent Cooper, did this seem work related?

COOPER
M'am, that's very hard to say.

TRUMAN
So Betty you're saying this behavior is part of the way the
Major operates.

MRS. BRIGGS
Let me ask you this: did he leave suddenly?

COOPER
Yes. We were speaking philosophically. Then I left the
site to answer a call of nature. He was gone when I
returned.

MRS. BRIGGS
The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.

TRUMAN
In what way?

MRS. BRIGGS
All I know is he talks about them constantly.

COOPER
In what way?

MRS. BRIGGS
(all she'll offer)
Confidential ways.

TRUMAN
(a look at Cooper)
Betty, I'm afraid there's not much we can do now except
keep an eye out. He can't be considered legally missing
until after 24 hours.

COOPER
Be patient, Mrs. Briggs. Your husband has a renaissance
passion for exploration. That approach creates its own
schedules.

MRS. BRIGGS
That is how he sees himself. There's no manual for it;
there's also no manual for being married to it.
(stands)
Garland left some brief notes on his nightstand. I'll call
you back with them.

TRUMAN
That might be helpful.

She exits.

COOPER
Harry, Major Briggs didn't wander off on some work
assignment. That flash of light I saw signified a power; a
force that lives in those woods.

ANDY BRENNAN and HAWK enter carrying a small white department store box.

ANDY
Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. Milford their wedding
gifts. It's a matching scarf and ascot set.

Andy digs into the white box and pulls out two loud, almost road-kill plaid scarves.

HAWK
Can't believe he's getting married again.

TRUMAN
We should just recycle gifts from the last wedding.

HAWK
(to Cooper)
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal thing. Like the return
of the salmon.

COOPER
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.

The INTERCOM sounds.

INTERCOM (WOMAN)
There's a call for a Dale Crewper ... long distance. Hope
I didn't cut it off.

TRUMAN
(to Cooper)
Temp.

Truman flips on the speaker phone. A moment passes. GORDON COLE.

COLE (PHONE)
HARRY, COOP? ARE WE THERE? THIS IS
GORDON COLE CALLING FROM BEND,
OREGON.

COOPER
We know, Gordon. How are you?

COLE
COOP, I JUST CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
INVESTIGATION BUSINESS. THESE ARE
HARD TIMES. WE GET THROUGH THEM.

COOPER
Thanks, Gordon.

COLE
IT RANKS POOR WITH ME, TOO. NOW COOP,
IS ANY OF THIS TRUE? DOUBLE HOMOCIDE?
STOLEN DRUGS? STORMING A
WHOREHOUSE?

COOPER
Gordon, it's a bunch of hogwash

COLE
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE DRUG
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY'S STARTING TO
NOSE AROUND. THEY'RE SENDING DOWN A
TOP DOG TO INVESTIGATE THE DRUG
ANGLE.

COOPER
Who is it? ... WHO'S THE AGENT?

COLE
DENNIS BRYSON.

COOPER
(primarily to Truman)
He's a good man, Harry. No nonsense.

Under which, HAWK enters.

HAWK
Cooper, they're ready for you in the hearing.

COOPER
That's it, Gordon. TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC.

COLE
DON'T LET'EM RATTLE YOU, COOP. THESE
GUYS MAKE A LIVING LOOKING THROUGH
OTHER PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. WE'VE ALL HAD
OUR SOCKS TOSSED AROUND. CATCH YOU
LATER.

Cole hangs up without fan fare. Cooper returns the receiver. Exchanges a look with Truman. Wish me luck.

4. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Sitting at the conference table is ROGER HARDY. On each side of him are TWO MEN in slate suits, with eyes as even as colored water. Before Hardy is an open folder, Cooper's badge, I.D. and gun. Cooper enters, closes the door and sits down. On the table between him and these three men sit three dark blue fedora hats.

COOPER
Roger.

HARDY
Dale.

A beat. The two underlings sit as still as bookends.

HARDY (CONT'D)
Showtime, Agent Cooper. You've heard the charges.
What do you wish to present in your defense?

COOPER
I have no defense.

The two operatives look over at Hardy, who stares inquisitively at Cooper. The man on Hardy's left, whose job it is to record testimony, tentatively takes down this response.

COOPER (CONT'D)
I'm completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
Some of it went down outside bureau stipulations, yes, I
accept that and I'll pay the price. But I'm innocent of
any criminal wrong doing. If they wish to charge me I'll
defend myself in a court of law.

HARDY
(to the man on his left)
Close the book.
(he does so; Hardy to Cooper)
Dale, there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. And
the first thing we expect a bureau man to do is stand up
for himself. A man who can't, who doesn't even try, may
be packing feathers where his spine's supposed to be.

COOPER
Roger, I know the move I'm supposed to make. And I
know the board.

HARDY
(palms turned upward)
So ...

COOPER
I've done a lot of thinking. And I've started to focus out
beyond the end of the board. On a bigger game.

HARDY
(losing patience)
What 'game'?

COOPER
The sound wind makes through the pines. The sentience
of animals. The last thought of a homeless man before he
takes a night's sleep. What we fear in the dark. And
what's beyond the dark.

HARDY
What the hell are you talking about?

COOPER
I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger. About
looking at the world with love.

HARDY
Cooper, you're liable to be extradited for murder and
drug trafficking -

COOPER
That's something I can't control -

HARDY
(hard stare)
Your suspension will continue in force. The next moves
are the Canadian government's and a DEA investigation,
which begins today.
(a slight softening)
You've cracked a big case. You've been under a lot of
pressure. I may recommend a full psychological work-up.

COOPER
(rises, pleasantly)
Thank you for your candor, Roger. So long fellas.

Cooper stands, looks over at his gun, badge and I.D. card, and starts away. ANGLE ON those objects, still sitting on the table, as we HEAR the door shut.

7. INT. WEIGHT ROOM

Now changed into his wrestling sweats, Mike joins other TEAM MEMBERS gathered around the weight machines, exchanging a few perfunctory greetings before going over to a seat at the leg press machine. Hyperventilating in preparation, he looks up at his buddies, who are looking back at him with curiously broad adolescent grins.

His sudden premonition of dread is answered by the bluejeaned figure dropping down into the neighboring machine seat; she sets the weight before allowing herself to peek over.

NADINE
Hi, Mike.

Mike turns his head in dismay. He is both supremely irritated by, and unequipped to deal with, this bizarre new shadow in his life. The guys are choking back amusement.

MIKE
Hello.

NADINE
(on a roll)
How are you?

MIKE
Just great. Listen, is there something you want?

NADINE
Now, Mike ... aren't we being a little forward?

Nonplussed, Mike starts working the leg extensions. It's all Nadine can do to keep her eyes off him. With the half-hearted dissemblance of a schoolgirl, she also starts doing leg presses; but she is doing them with six hundred pounds of weight.

The guys have stopped kidding. The room is virtually silent but for the lifting and pounding down of weight when the WRESTLING COACH robustly enters.

COACH
Thattaway, Nelson ... I keep telling you guys, it's leg
power that wins matches ....

He then pulls up to a stunned shuffle, seeing the magazine next to Mike's is hoisting double the weight. Being a coach, he is quick to recover.

COACH (CONTINUED)
And what's your name, little lady?

NADINE
(belle of the weight room)
Nadine Butler.

COACH
Tell me, Nadine ...
(big grin)
... ever give any thought to going out for the wrestling
team?

ANGLE ON Mike: will there be no escape from this girl?

8. EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DAY

Establish. On a barren stretch of the Interstate. A shoebox along the highwayside, with a sunlit neon shingle that reads, "The Broken Bones". Parked in the foreground is an old white Corvette convertible with a weather-worn red interior.

9. INT. ROADSIDE BAR

Dark. Near empty. Clearly a place that lives on night receipts and stray afternoon beers. The BARTENDER steals a glance over at his only customer, an intent, demure BLONDE in a purple silk jacket, mid-twenties. A wistful sadness clings to her like perfume.

JAMES HURLEY enters, takes a seat two down and orders a beer. It arrives. The bartender fades into the background. James takes a long first drink, aware he's being watched.

WOMAN
Hi.

He moves his head a quarter turn, sees her through one eye and looks back into his beer.

JAMES
H'lo.

She kills the rest of a tequila, ice. There's another waiting beside it:

WOMAN
Headed somewhere?

JAMES
I'm sorry?

WOMAN
Is is someplace you're going or running from?

JAMES
You got it all wrong. I'm alright.

WOMAN
Men are always alright. Right up until they pull the
trigger.

The bartender snorts his amusement. Her return look pushes him further into the background.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
Then the neighbors march solemnly out to the news
cameras to tell us, "He was such a nice, quiet guy."

JAMES
I'm only quiet on the outside.

WOMAN
I can almost hear what's inside from here.

He relapses into a characteristic silence; feeling she's been a little harsh on this stranger, her manner softens.

WOMAN
There was a woman involved.

JAMES
A few of them. Actually.

WOMAN
So you were outnumbered. We don't fight fair.
(ice against glass)
'Live nearby?

JAMES
Twin Peaks.
(meaning her eyes:)
That's a nice jacket.

WOMAN
(dismissingly)
I'm glad you think so. Can you ... do anything with cars?

JAMES
Sure. 'Having problems with that Corvette?

WOMAN
No. While he was away on business, I foolishly took my
husband's Dusenburg out on the road. Someone squeezed
me on the highway, I ran it into a ditch. It would be a
very good idea for me to have the car repaired before my
husband, comes home.

JAMES
I could take a look.
(sips for courage)
My name's James.

WOMAN
Evelyn. Evelyn Marsh.
(sips for pleasure)
I live just up the road.

In the silence, he hears her legs crossing under the bar.

JAMES
We in a hurry?
(she smiles, shakes her head)
Mind if I play the box first?

EVELYN
(slides him down a quarter)
I don't exactly punch a clock, myself.

James slowly steps over to the jukebox. Something about this offer feels like more than it says it is. He puts on a slow, soulful song about a wasted, violet life.

As James stands in the jukebox light looking for his next selection, the CAMERA recedes, leaving them to the music, the dark empty bar, the bartender cleaning glasses.

ANDY BRENNAN is practicing his gun draw, taking aim at a calendar. We hear NOISE from an entryway. Andy turns, lowered gun still absent-mindedly in hand, to see RICHARD TREMAYNE entering with 'little brother', NICKY, a wide-eyed vulnerable-looking little boy. Both are staring at the gun, which Andy holsters then extends a greeting to rival suitor.

ANDY
Good day, Dick.

TREMAYNE
Hello, Andy. This is Little Nicky, my charge from
Happy Helping Hand. Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.

ANDY
How do you do, young fella.

NICKY
Hi.

TREMAYNE
Andrew, old boy, Nicky and I just stopped off at
Horne's for a new wardrobe, we're just on our way for a
malted and we were hoping Lucy could join us.

ANDY
Oh shoot, Dick, Lucy's up at the Great Northern today
helping with the Milford wedding.

TREYMAYNE
Oh God,. that 's right; Dougie's getting married again.

NICKY
Lucy's not here?

TREMAYNE
Yes, unfortunately we'll have to meet Lucy another time.

Nicky realizes his dread: another abandonment. He looks up anxiously.

NICKY
But you, you promised. Where is she?

TREMAYNE
I'm afraid Lucy's very busy right now and doesn't have
time for us.

More resonance. The child begins lightly, silently crying. This is too much for Andy.

ANDY
You know, Dick this is just about my lunch hour ... and if
you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy taking you two guys out
for a malted. How would that be?

NICKY
(brightening)
Oh boy!

A look of gratitude, mixed with a little suspicion from Treymayne.

10A. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Hawk and Truman enter to find Cooper, pouring coffee from a pitcher on Truman's desk.

COOPER
(pouring himself some coffee)
Harry. Nine years ago I joined the bureau because I felt
it was the strongest statement I could make about the man
I wanted to become and the world I wanted to live in.
And now, suddenly all that's brushed aside. I have
absolutely no responsiblities. Nothing to do. And it
feels ...
(laser-eyed delight)
... fantastic.

Cooper sips from his cup. Looks up at Truman with a disbelieving stare; then suddenly spits coffee halfway across the room. Truman shakes his head in amusement.

TRUMAN
Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.

COOPER
(putting down the cup)
Sorry about that.

TRUMAN
That's alright. We still need to clean up Hawk's.

HAWK
Drain water.
TRUMAN
Coop ... what will you do if you can't clear yourself?

COOPER
Harry, last night, Major Briggs planted a seed in my
mind. And it's been germinating. The idea that by
focusing on our fears or desires about something, we give
them tremendous power. Consider this, Harry: perhaps
by our best-intentioned resistance of evil, we somehow
unknowingly join hands with it. Perpetuate it.
(he has lost the sheriff)
And now, being suspended, I'm suddenly empowered to
let go of my preoccupation with wrongdoing. I feel like
I've been exiled back to the natural rhythms of life.

TRUMAN
Well, if you ever come to feel you need a home base,
there'll always be a job for you here in Twin Peaks.

COOPER
(with emphatic gratitude)
Harry, in a world of continuing disorder, you are a rock.
Oh, Mrs. Briggs called. The notes beside Major Briggs's
bed? A rather detailed grocery list and a small
endearment. Nothing more.
(his eyes light up)
Hawk, Harry have either of you ever heard of a place
called the White Lodge.

TRUMAN
Can't say that I have.

Hawk's initial reply is a look of concern.

HAWK
Where did you hear of it?

COOPER
It was the last thing Major Briggs mentioned before he
disappeared. You know of it?

HAWK
(a cautious look at Harry)
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world. But there are
other worlds.

COOPER
Tell me more.

HAWK
Local legend. The White Lodge is a place where the
spirits that rule man and nature here reside.

COOPER
That's a place I'd like to see.

HAWK
Many have tried. They say it exists only on the spiritual
plane.

TRUMAN
(sitting; here we go again)
Maybe I'd better pull up a chair.

HAWK
There is also a legend of a place called The Black Lodge:
the shadow self of the White Lodge, a place of dark
forces that pull on this world. A world of nightmares:
shamans reduced to crying children; angry spirits pouring
from the woods; graves opening like flowers.

COOPER
Dangerous.

HAWK
The legend says every spirit must pass through there on
the path to perfection. There you will meet your own
shadow self. My people call it the Dweller on the
Threshold. But it is said that if you confront the Black
Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate
your soul.

COOPER
Holy Smokes.

Just then: an intercom BUZZ. The temp's vaguely confused VOICE is heard:

TEMP'S VOICE
Agent Crewper? Agent Bryson here to see you.

COOPER
(to Hawk and Truman)
Dennis and I worked together in Oakland a couple years
back. Broke a smuggling ring. One of the finest minds in
the DEA, Harry. We're in good hands.

A KNOCK is heard. All turn toward the door.

MAN (O.S.)
Coop?

They look up: leaning fetchingly against the doorframe is a thin MAN in an Ann Taylor suit. Long skirt. Light makeup.

COOPER
... Dennis?

MAN IN DRESS
It's a long story, but I prefer Denise if you don't mind.

COOPER
Okay. This is Sheriff Truman. Deputy Hawk.

DENISE
Pleased. Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.

Oblivious to the stares, Bryson sits and opens his briefcase. He is clearly business first.

DENISE (CONT'D)
Nice ride out here ... hard to believe you even have any
crime, Sheriff, I picture you chasing lost dogs, locking
up the town drunk ...

TRUMAN
It's a little more involved.

DENISE
Let's move right through this, Dale. The DEA's interest
stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer that
you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.

COOPER
Patently untrue: Denise, I believe I'm being set up.

DENISE
My recent experience has taught me never to judge too
quickly.
(closes briefcase)
I'll get right to work on this and be back to you later
today. I understand we're both staying at the Great
Northern. How's the food up there?

COOPER
You're in for a real surprise.

TRUMAN
(aside)
So are they.

DENISE
(stands; to Cooper)
Let's catch up later. I want to tell you all about my new
life.
(borderline flirtatious)
Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff. Deputy.

Denise goes. Cooper, Truman and Hawk. A long beat.

Hi, Nadine. Have you heard anything from James?

NADINE
You mean Ed's friend, with the motorcycle?

DONNA
Yes.

NADINE
He hasn't come around for a couple of days, listen, I
gotta ask you something, I hope you won't think this is
too personal ...

DONNA
What?

NADINE
Are you like, still going out with, you know, Mike or
anything?

DONNA
No.

NADINE
(quiet exaltation)
Oh, yea.

DONNA
Why?

NADINE
You have to promise to say anything, promise, okay?
(Donna nods)
I think there may be some major chemistry developing ...
omi God, there he is.

Mike approaches, Nadine hurries to him, girlishly leans into his path.

NADINE
Hi, Mike. Guess who's thinking about going out for the
wrestling team?

Donna looks over at Mike; this can't be true. Wrestling? Mike shrugs back in the affirmative.

NADINE (CONT'D)
I promise to take it easy on you in practice.

Mike, who's had enough, smiles acidly and moves on. Nadine watches hungrily.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Look at those buns. Cowabunga.

DONNA
Nadine ... what about Ed?
(a blank stare)
Aren't you ... still seeing him?

NADINE
Yeah, sorta.

DONNA
Well ... if you're seeing Ed, how can you, you know, start
seeing Mike?

NADINE
(shrugs)
Ed's at home. Mike's at school. Ed stays in. Mike likes
to go out. And let's be realistic. Sometimes Ed acts like
he's old enough to be my father. Catch you later.

That one loses Donna completely. Nadine scampers off.

12. INT. TRUMAN'S CABIN - AFTERNOON

JOSIE'S sitting up in bed, finishing her lunch. Truman sits at her bedside.

TRUMAN
All right. It's time you tell me where you've been and
what you've been through. I have to know the truth. I
can't go on doing this, being with you unless I know.

JOSIE
(stroking his face)
Harry ...

He takes her hand gently but firmly away from his face.

TRUMAN
The truth.

JOSIE
(pause, completely different tone)
I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is
Thomas Eckhardt. He ... helped me. He took me off the
streets when I was sixteen. If you're from a poor family,
sometimes they ... sell the female children. I was lucky.

Truman struggles to keep his emotional resolve.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
He taught me about life and he taught me about business.
He was my father. My master. My lover. I never
questioned him or anything he did. Then a day came
when I learned too much. He had a man killed, a business
partner who had wronged him. Murdered. I saw it done.

TRUMAN
Did you go to the police?

JOSIE
He owns the police. When I met Andrew Packard I was
already afraid for my life. Andrew was also a business
partner. He was good and kind, and when he asked me to
marry him, I said yes, to come with him, and to get away
from Eckhardt.

TRUMAN
Who was this Mr. Lee? Your "cousin?"

JOSIE
Harry, I'm sorry. I was trying to keep you out of this.
The less you know the better -

TRUMAN
Who was he?

JOSIE
That man works for Eckhardt. And he said if I didn't go
back with him he would kill you.

TRUMAN
Why?

JOSIE
Because Eckhardt wants me. He's never stopped wanting
me. He think I'm his property. When Andrew was alive
he could protect me. I now believe Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.
(pauses, makes sure Truman's buying - he is)
Jonathan was driving me to the airport in Seattle. I
jumped out of the car. I'd rather die. I'd rather die than
go back to that monster ...

TRUMAN
Josie, stop. You're here with me.

JOSIE
(tearing up)
Now he'll kill both of us.

Truman takes her in his arms. Quiet. Determined.

TRUMAN
Let him try.

ACT THREE

FADE IN:

13. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

Andy, Tremayne, and Little Nicky sit together at the counter. Nicky seated angelically, between them. Norma enters, pours a refill, spots a new customer seated nearby. Roger Hardy looks up from his newspaper.

NORMA
May I help you?

HARDY
(business-like as usual)
I'd like a cup of coffee, please. And some of that pie I
keep hearing about.

NORMA
(friendly)
Coming up. You won't be disappointed.

Norma turns to go. But familiar voices catch her attention. HANK and ERNIE enter, singing a hunting song, spirited and sleepless from the expedition. Ernie looks far the more worn; he as clearly had his clock cleaned by a thorough professional.

HANK
Hello, sunshine. Can we get some coffee?

Hank drifts toward the back, Ernie drops onto a counter seat, where Norma immediately draws him some coffee. Ernie trombones into a handkefchief.

NORMA
How was the hunting expedition? Catch anything?

HANK
(sotto voce)
Hope not.

ERNIE
Catch anything? I came across a twelve-point buck
standing by a deepwater stream; looked me right in the
eye, wouldn't budge. Almost like he was toying with
me. I made a soft approach, lined him up dead center
and...
("shoots")
A steady eye. A steady hand. That's the secret.

She hands him his coffee, smelling more bourbon on him than bush. Knows he's lying.

NORMA
You should have taken along a camera. Is it being
mounted?

ERNIE
Ah ... yes, probably as we speak. It was great. Just great.
(uncomfortably caught in the lie, stands)
Well, I'm going back to check in on your momma.

NORMA
She went back to Seattle.

ERNIE
Seattle?

NORMA
(genuine concern)
That's where you should go, too.

Hank returns from the back. Ernie pulls away from Norma.

NORMA (CONTINUED)
Take care, Ernie.

HANK
Hey, buddy, what's with the long puss.

ERNIE
Vivian's gone back to Seattle.

HANK
Better for you, buckeroo. You've got four kilos to unload,
you don't want the ball and chain getting in the way, do you?

ERNIE
I suppose not.

HANK
Better hit the phones, Hot Rod. We're on a deadline.

Ernie starts unenthusiastically toward the pay phone; Hank heads back to the kitchen. PICK UP Norma as she delivers their orders to little Nicky, Andy and Treymayne.

NORMA
Two coffees, two pieces of three-berry pie ...

NICKY
How much does that cost?

TREMAYNE
(taking it and passing it to Nicky)
I'm sure I don't know. And one super snow-frosted Twin
Peaks DoubleR chocolate malted.

ANDY
(to Nicky, engagingly)
Looks just like White Tail Mountain, doesn't it Nicky?

With a sudden burst from his little lungs, Nicky blows fiercely at the cream, causing it to fly up into Andy's face. Tremayne laughs like a hyena. Andy fumbles for some napkins.

NICKY
Sorry, Uncle Andy.

Andy smiles. Uncle. Who could not love this kid?

TREMAYNE
Now you look like White Tail Mountain, Andrew.
Looks like you got a little on you too, Nicholas. We
don't want to filthy up that stylish little shirt.

Tremayne reaches across Nicky to the napkin dispenser. Nicky begins rolling the base of his malted along its circumference, like a tiring spun coin, then accidentally lets it drop forward, spilling his malted all over the extended left arm of Tremayne's natty, expensive sport coat.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Damn it! Damn it!

Nicky immediately begins to cry.

TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
(recovering)
That's okay. It's fine, Nicky. It's completely all right.

Tremayne reaches over the counter for some more serious cleanup materials. Andy leans away from the chocolate spreading over the counter to lunge for some napkins. Little Nicky, with slightly unexpected strength gives Andy's stool a mighty spin. Still facing away from them as he cleans himself off, Andy lowers himself back onto the edge of his seat, hits the spinning stool and flies directly to the floor. Norma and Tremayne look up from their mopwork.

CLOSE ON Nicky, his cherubic face still streaked with whipped cream, the slight upward curve of his lips suggesting a tiny, unsettling smile.

Establish. An expansive house backing into a forest.

CUT TO:


16. INT. OPEN GARAGE - DAY

James and Evelyn stand beside her husband's Dusenberg up on blocks.

EVELYN
I got a garage man to come out yesterday. Not that I
understood a single word he said. Something vague about
the front axle? He said he'll have to order it from God
knows where.

JAMES
(looking under the car)
Germany. Your garage man's playing it safe. I can put
this right. God, it's really beautiful.

She comes around closer, half-curious.

EVELYN
Jeffrey loves this car. My husband. Loves the car.

JAMES
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?

EVELYN
I'm not sure this week. He travels extensively. Business.
(her palm flows along the hood)
The car was built in 1923. Jeffrey has to have the most
unique and beautiful toys. And they have to be perfect.
He's that way about everything he owns.
(beat)
I could have learned something from that; if I'd been
paying attention.
(he looks at her, feeling the undercurrent)
Are you that way, James? ... About your bike?

JAMES
Guess I'm not so interested in how my bike looks as I am
in where it can take me.

EVELYN
Where do you want to go?

JAMES
(grins)
It's not a place. It's a feeling.
(coming up from the car, looking out at the
road)
Sometimes riding at night, I punch off my headlight, turn
up the throttle and just go for it.

EVELYN
(smolders a little then)
So ... think you can fix it?

JAMES
Sure.

EVELYN
There's a room above the garage. You can stay there while
you work. If you like. Room and board. Whatever else
you think is fair. I really do need to have it done before
Jeffrey returns.
(beat, softly, not coy)
I'd like you to stay, James. I'd enjoy the company.

JAMES
Okay.

EVELYN
Good. It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.

James glances at her, feeling this fresh allure. She turns and starts away. James wonders a little at her tone, and what he might be getting himself into.

CUT TO:


17. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

START CLOSE on a projector screen surrounded by darkness. Flickering before us is silent footage of Ben as a young boy, eagerly witnessing a groundbreaking ceremony. Images of young Ben, Jerry, their bearded FATHER, dance across the screen. Horne Sr. shoves a spade into the ground, unearths the ceremonial soil. All clap and celebrate. Smiles abound. In a background a large sign proclaims: FUTURE SITE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL. It's a sentimental journey back to a simpler time and place.

PULL BACK from the screen into the darkened office, shades drawn, to Ben, seated in the screen's reflected light watching his old glory days, sipping from a crystal glass, a nearly empty bourbon bottle beside him, cigar smoke snaking up through the projector's beam. Then, quietly at first, eyes fixed upon the screen ... Ben recites:

BEN
"Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious
summer by this sun of York; And in all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house/In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried./Now are our brows bound with victorious
wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our
stern alarums changed to merry meetings; Our dreadful
marches to delightful measures."

A door opens. The silhouette in the doorway causes Ben to immediately douse the projector and turn on his desk lamp. On the desk are a box of kleenex and several silver gravity toys. Hank enters.

HANK
A stag party. And I wasn't even invited.

BEN
Hank, where have you been?

HANK
Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.

BEN
Do you know what kind of hell I've been through the last
few days? You said you took care of Catherine in the
mill fire: she's alive. And as you might imagine, not
happy about it. Through extortion and trickery, she's now
managed to cheat me out of both Ghostwood and the
mill. And then there's the small matter of my being
arrested for killing Laura Palmer, a real business-
enhancer, on top of which my trusted solicitor, the late
Leland Palmer turns out to a homocidal lunatic!

Ben's eye is drawn to Laura's picture on his desk. He grows somber.

HANK
Tough week, Ben.

BEN
(a new obsession)
Do you think the furniture in this room is arranged
adequately? I've been toying with the notion that if one
could find the proper spatial relationship between all the
objects in a given space, it could create a resonance the
benefits of which to the individual dwelling in that space
could be extensive and far reaching. Help me move this
desk, would you?

Ben asks for a hand with the desk.

HANK
That's fascinating, Ben, really, listen, though, what we
have to do now is talk about One-Eyed Jacks.

BEN
Jacks, yes, One-Eyed Jacks, uh-huh.

HANK
Here's how it is, Ben. Ben, you're out.

BEN
Excuse me? I own One-Eyed Jack's.

HANK
There's been a friendly takeover.

BEN
You walk in here under my employ and have the gall -

HANK
Oh, that's another thing. I don't work for you anymore.

BEN
(controlling his rage)
Renault. Jean Renault. It's Renault, isn't it?
(no reply, but Ben knows)
Hank, that man is a psychopath. A psychopath! You're
dancing with the devil!

HANK
Ben, you're a nut.

BEN
You think I'm going to sit here and take this lying down?

HANK
Ben. Life is change Listen to me when I tell you this is
how it's going to be -

BEN
Don't patronize me, you goon.

Hank steps forward and gives Ben a long look. A Hank special. The room's power shifts.

HANK
Look at you. You're a mess. You screwed up, boss man.
You're out, Ben.

Hank exits. Ben glares at the door, then glances over at the burbon bottle. The blank projector screen, the hum of the projector. He pours himself a drink, slouches back in the chair, bathed in the light of the projector. A beat. Ben manages a bizarre smile and makes shadow puppets on the wall. Little dancing rabbits for his own amusement.

18. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY

Wedding preparations are in evidence. A bad ACCORDIAN PLAYER is warming up in background. Cooper enters, makes his way to the front desk to collect his mail.

18A. INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Cooper enters his hotel room, notices a larger envelope among the others. He opens it. Inside is a micro-cassette and a card that reads: P to Q4

COOPER
(to himself, alarmed)
Windom Earle.

Cooper quickly takes out his recorder. He pops the tape in and hits play and listens with growing horror ...

WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
(think of Orson Welles)
Of course you couldn't help but take note of my
emphatically traditional opening. I must say your
responding move was nothing if not reflective of your
predeliction for the tidy and fastidious. See how my
response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are
my true intentions? How will you answer this time?
Hobgoblins, Dale; consistency, predictibility, giving rise
to patterns. We both know only too well how these
patterns leave you vulnerable to attack. You with your
wounds. I with mine. Let me paint you a picture. My
knights will skirmish. Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks. Pawns will naturally be
forfeit. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because
I assure you, dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any
cost. The king must die.

The tape ends. Cooper grows pale.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

19. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Before the fireplace, the wedding ceremony of DOUGIE and LANA BUDDING is in progress. Steady and easy, Dougie stands in a herringbone sports jacket and evergreen slacks. Lana, her full body alight with flows of white and pink chiffon, looks something like an exploding birthday cake.

The REVEREND performs the ceremony with a respectful air, seemingly dissembling his own skepticism. The best man is PETE MARTELL; the maid of honor AUDREY HORNE. Beyond them is a half-moon gallery seated in Great Northern dining chairs, with no separation based on family (hers is not there). Some of those seated are Truman, Andy, Hawk, LOG LADY, and a disgusted DWAYNE MILFORD, patting the hand of an older, blue-haired WOMAN. Her stone-face suggests she is less than thrilled with the ongoing nuptials.

REVEREND
Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your
wife, to love and cherish, for as long as you both shall live.

DOUGIE
You bet, Reverend.

REVEREND
And do you, Lana Budding, take this man to be your
husband, to love honor and obey, so long as you both shall
live?

LANA
I do, your Honor.

REVEREND
If there be anyone here who knows not why this union
should be made, let him speak now or forever hold his -

DWAYNE
(leaping to his feet)
You're damned straight I object - that little
golddigger's after his money, his publishing empire, and
God knows what else - look at him, he's already got one
foot in the grave!

Truman and Hawk quickly hustle Dwayne off into the background.

TRUMAN
Okay, easy there, Mr. Mayor.

DWAYNE
(yelling as he exits)
Why isn't anybody from her family here? Any of you
asked yourselves that? Kind of peculiar, don't you think?

Pause. Dougie quietly comforts Lana.

DOUGIE
Don't give it another thought, doll.

REVEREND
So if there are no further objections ...

CUT TO:


20. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Cooper stands at his window, tape machine in hand.

COOPER
Diane, I am standing at the window of my room at the
Great Northern, looking down at the wedding of Dougie
Milford and his youthful bride. The ceremony appears
quite simple; the groom, commencing his fifth marriage,
has apparently honed the procedure down to the bone.
The reception will be starting shortly and a good deal of
alcohol will undoubtedly be consumed in order to
accomodate our culturally prevelant rally discomfort with
mystery and ritual.
(turns from window, sets down recorder, begins
to dress, speaks while peering in mirror)
Diane, I anticipate your question. I am not down among
the revelers because my mind is burdened with questions:
what's become of Major Briggs? What is the true
significance of the White and Black Lodge? Has the
Major, clearly a man of no small spiritual advancement,
perhaps been attempting to make contact with some
element of these places in his top-secret work? Briggs is a
man of clear eye and deep thought; he sees right through
the illusory texture of this world and fluently reads
beneath it. You might meet a handful like him in a
lifetime. But if what Hawk has related to me about the
Black Lodge is true, even a man of Briggs' considerable
fortitude would be tested to his ultimate limits.
(sits down on the bed)
In an even darker corner of my thoughts is my old partner,
Windom Earle, the man who, prior to his utter mental
and emotional collapse, burned with a brilliance I doubt
I will ever see the equal of. Add to that the things I've
witnessed here at Twin Peaks: the tremendous evil forces
that linger on the periphery of this genuine, spirited little
town. The darkness Laura Palmer submitted to. The
vortex that swallowed and consumed Leland Palmer ...
Diane, as a human being learns and matures, one's
experiences grow proportionately more rich and
mysterious. Perhaps the questions I now seek answers to
lie beyond the old perameters. Beyond my life at the
bureau.

The phone rings. He clicks off. Picks up.

COOPER (CONT'D)
Cooper ... yes, Denise ... I'll be right down.

He hangs up, stands to put his coat on, clicks on the recorder one more time.

COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, when I've got a bit more time, remind me to tell
you about Agent Bryson ...

DISSOLVE TO:


21. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT

A mix of local townspeople and Dougie's friends. Cooper works his way through to find Dennis/Denise waiting at the bar.

DENISE
Bad news first. I found cocaine residue in your car. My
guess is it's going to be a match to lot stolen from the
Mountie.

COOPER
Dennis, this can't look straight to you.

DENISE
Denise.

COOPER
Sorry.

DENISE
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop. But I'm going to need
more than your opinion to make that stick.

COOPER
Can you help me?

DENISE
(sips demurely)
That gets into a delicate area. But on the other hand I'm
trying very hard lately to be more in touch with my
feelings ...
(to the bartender)
Could I have another daquiri please?

COOPER
Dennis, if you don't mind my asking, what the hell
happened to you?

DENISE
Not at all. It's good to talk about it. It's simple,
really. Last year I was working undercover on a suburban
surveillance, some Bolivians were moving coke out of a
house across the street ... the seller had a few kinks, his rep
was he'd only sell to transvestites. So my partner and I
shacked up. I played the buyer and I found that wearing
women's clothes ... relaxed me. I continued wearing them
into the night. My partner thought it was my consummate
professionalism. It was a very confusing two weeks.

COOPER
To say the least.

DENISE
So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a
specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation
Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is
to dress the part for six months prior to any further
therapy; hormones, electrolysis -

COOPER
(more than he wanted to hear)
This is all a pretty astounding disclosure, Denise.

DENISE
Imagine how surprised I was. This isn't something you
exactly plan on.

A happy commotion from the reception across the room.

CUT TO:


22. PETE MARTELL AND DWAYNE MILFORD

Seated a small table along the way, Pete and Dwayne sit over a couple drinks, watching Dougie cuddle with his bride over the cutting of the wedding cake.

DWAYNE
She started by taking one of Dougie's college classes.
Ethics in Modern Journalism. Two things I guarantee you
that little bird knows nothing about. Three weeks later
she's landed a job writing for the Gazette. Dougie's
always been a sucker. A woman walks by with play in her
eyes and jello in her walk, and he's a trout on a hook.

PETE
We all kinda' live in that glass house, don't you think,
Dwayne?

DWAYNE
I was married to the same woman for half a century, god
rest her soul. That's because I think with my brain, not
my garden hose -

PETE
(trying to be positive)
Music turned out pretty good.

DWAYNE
Oughta' be a death march.

Across the room, Lana holds the ceremonial bouquet before a host of eager women. She flings it up into a looping flight, from where it's suddenly snatched by an agile Denise. There's some surly mumbling amongst the other girls about the bouquet-snagging by this ringer. Denise sashays back to the bar, where Truman has now joined Cooper.

DENISE
Unfair advantage. How many of those girls were Varsity
wide receivers?

TRUMAN
Hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon. We've
had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice. Happens
every wedding. My theory is Dwayne's jealous.

The ensemble music kicks up again. Denise looks a little wistful. Lana and Dougie swing by in greeting.

DOUGIE
Sheriff, arrest this woman. She's too beautiful to be
living in this state.

LANA
Dougie, you say the sweetest things...
(a glance at Cooper)
Aren't you the FBI man?

COOPER
Not currently, no.

Truman and Bryson's respectful silence.

COOPER (CONT'D)
Dale Cooper.

LANA
You solved the Laura Palmer case.

DOUGIE
Come on, my darling, they're playing our tune.

They move off. Coming up on the periphery of this circle is Audrey Horne, approaching Cooper, who pivots slightly on his barstool, folding them into a semi-private exchange.

AUDREY
Excuse me. Didn't you ... rescue me once?

COOPER
That's one version of the story.

AUDREY
One last dance?

Cooper accompanies her off to the dance floor. Denise sways slightly. It is now just he and Truman. And Andy, hovering nearby.

DENISE
I love this music.
(waits for a response)
God ... I feel a little awkward. I .. would you ...

Truman's eyes widen with understanding. It's a waltz. Not that it really matters what it is.

TRUMAN
I'm not ... much of a dancer.

An awkward pause.

ANDY
(gallantly inserting himself)
May I have this dance?

DENISE
Thank you.

Denise takes Andy's arm, as they move over toward the floor.

TRUMAN
(to himself)
He's a nice guy but everybody's got their limits.

CUT TO:


Pete and Lana dancing, with a surprising compatibility.

PETE
You dance like a scream.

LANA
Thanks. You move very smoothly, too.

PETE
Thanks.

Lana looks at him with bubbly respect. MOVE OFF to Cooper dancing with Audrey.

AUDREY
I heard you might be in trouble.

COOPER
Trouble in this instance, Audrey, may be a door to a new
way of looking at the world.

AUDREY
I guess you could say that about everything you do.

COOPER
That's my hope, Audrey and my aspiration.

AUDREY
Well, if you ever decide to come down off the mountain
top and mingle with us regular folks, I'd like to hear
some of your stories.

COOPER
It's a deal. I hope they're interesting ones.

She smiles. He returns it. MOVE OFF them to Andy and Denise; Denise is an excellent dancer. And, surprise ... so is Andy. HOLD ON them for a beat. Something absurd and sweet in Harry's gentlemanly acceptance. Couples now swirl about CAMERA, in a celebratory rhythm ...

DISSOLVE TO:


23. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a framed photograph on the table: it is a closeup of Andrew Packard. SHOT OPENS to show Josie Packard enter this living room and take a seat. CATHERINE MARTELL sits assuredly across from her behind the desk.

JOSIE
Thank you for seeing me.

Catherine says nothing; her eyes give a quick glimmer of amusement.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
Believe it or not, I came here to help you.
(Catherine's exhale of disbelief)
I won't waste your time. Your brother, my husband,
Andrew Packard ...
(a respectful glance over at the photograph)
... was killed by a man named Thomas Eckhardt.

Catherine's face retains its emotionless appearance.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
Eight years ago, Andrew got the better of Eckhardt in a
business deal. Eckhardt never forgets a slight. He sets an
hour aside every day to think about how he will ruin his
enemies. In this case, I was his answer. He introduced
me to Andrew. I was to make Andrew fall in love with
me, marry him and eventually help Eckhardt kill him.

Josie pauses, awaiting Catherine's response. She looks back in quiet arrogance.

CATHERINE
Dear, your slip is showing.

JOSIE
Excuse me?

CATHERINE
(being clearer)
Tell me something I don't already know.

A beat. Josie hides her dismay.

JOSIE
Eckhardt is the most evil man I've ever known. His
design was to ruin the Packard family, not just Andrew.
I've escaped him for the moment, but he'll come back for
me. And for you. That is why I'm here.

CATHERINE
How endearing.

JOSIE
Catherine, you're in terrible danger.

CATHERINE
You help kill my brother, try to cheat me out of my land,
my family's lifeblood, utterly destroy my existence and
now you want to save me.

JOSIE
I had to do those things to stay alive. There is no one else
I can turn to. My insurance payment has been held up
pending an arson investigation. Ben gave me a five
million dollar check that is utterly worthless.

CATHERINE
(she knows all about it)
How unfortunate ...

JOSIE
(her final plea)
I have no money. I am at your mercy.

Having tired of this entertainment, Catherine moves a pawn forward.

CATHERINE
Enough. Save your tears. Be practical: what do you
propose we do?

JOSIE
I don't know ...

Catherine's thoughtful moment. Josie watches her.

CATHERINE
Then I'll tell you. From now on, you work for me. Here
at the house. As a maid. You'll move your things to the
servant's quarters. If you disobey me, if you lie to me, if
you contradict a single thing I tell you, I'll find this
Eckhardt myself and feed you to him by hand. Is that
clear?

Josie is shocked. Chastened.

CATHERINE (CONTINUED)
Speak.

JOSIE
Yes I understand.

CATHERINE
Fine. We'll talk about this Eckhardt and what we plan to
do another time. You may go to your room.

JOSIE
Yes. Thank you.

CATHERINE
I'll take breakfast at seven in my room. Coffee, juice,
dry toast, oatmeal.

JOSIE
(even quieter)
Yes.

CATHERINE
(smiles)
Sweet dreams.

Josie goes. ANGLE back onto the table's photograph of Andrew. A NOISE from inside the house. Someone entering this room.

SHOT OPENS to reveal a MAN standing beside the table. It is the man in the photograph. ANDREW PACKARD.

CATHERINE
(with a satisfied smirk)
Happy, Andrew?

ANDREW
(with a nod)
Everything is going exactly as we planned.

CATHERINE
And now ... ?

ANDREW
And now, dear sister. We wait for Thomas Eckhardt to
come looking for his one true love. And when he does ...

Is a dog man’s best friend? I had a dog. The dog was large. It ate my garden, all the plants, and much earth. The dog ate so much earth it died. Its body went back to the earth. I have a memory of this dog. The memory is all that I have left of my dog. He was black and white.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

MUSIC: ANDY’S THEME   48K

We FOCUS on the closed double-doors to the office. Just to the side of the door is a small brass deer statue. The doors open and BOBBY BRIGGS lets himself into the office and closes the door behind himself. BOBBY peers to the left wall where most of the furniture in the room has been assembled on top of each other in a symmetrical fashion. Starring at the wall, he walks into the office.

BOBBY
Mr. Horne.

BOBBY walks around the desk, which sits in the middle of the room, and spots BENJAMIN HORNE. BEN, unshaven and wearing a robe with a loose odd necktie, sits quietly on the floor beside the assemblage of furniture.

BOBBY
Mr. Horne? Your secretary said to come in.

Worried by BEN’S lack of response BOBBY gives his name in case he doesn’t remember him.

BOBBY
Bobby Briggs?

BENJAMIN
Bobby do you know what you have to have in this life? Hmm?

BOBBY shrugs.

BENJAMIN
Guts.

MUSIC: AUDREY’S DANCE (SAX ONLY)

BENJAMIN
Distance. Symmetry

Holding a lit cigar, BEN stands up and walks up to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Look.

BEN points to the assemblage of furniture.

BENJAMIN
Its a beautiful thing isn’t it? Hmm?

BEN walks over to the assemblage, climbs it and moves his wood carved nameplate, ‘BEN’, to a higher position on the assemblage.

BOBBY
Uhh Mr. Horne, did you listen to that tape I sent you?

Still standing on the assemblage, BEN turns and hunches down to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Yes I listened to your tape Bobby. Frankly, I am surprised that Leo could master the technology. (laughs) Damb it Bobby what do you want? Hmm?

BOBBY rakes his fingers together as he puts his hands together.

BOBBY
Mr. Horne I have a great admiration for you.

BENJAMIN
Admiration is for poets and dairy cows, Bobby.

BOBBY
I uh ... don’t know what you mean. I uh ...

BEN hops off the assemblage and stands next to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Bobby, you’re standing in front of a mammoth sky scraper.


INSERT: FURNITURE ASSEMBLAGE

We FOCUS on the symmetrical furniture assemblage and PAN UP to the top.

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
A leviathan that rips a hole in the clouds.


BACK TO SCENE:

BENJAMIN
Now, what is the first question that comes to your mind?

BEN takes a puff from his cigar. Baffled, BOBBY stares at the assemblage.

BOBBY
Uhmm.

BENJAMIN
The first question that you ask yourself is; ‘what’s on the top floor, who’s up there in the penthouse and why.’ Now that’s who I am.

BEN points at BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Are you?

BOBBY turns to BEN.

BOBBY
Yeah, of course I am, yes.

Pleased, BEN extends an arm around BOBBBY and tugs at him.

BENJAMIN
Bobby (laughs) opportunity knocks.

BEN walks over to his desk, picks up a small brown leather case and opens it.

BENJAMIN
I want you to follow Hank Jennings.

BEN removes a camera from the case and hands it to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
I want you to chronicle his existence.

BEN closes the leather case.

BENJAMIN
Show me something ... that I don’t already know.

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

In the hallway just outside the double doors to BENJAMIN’S office, LANA BUDDING MILFORD, in a white dress, screams and runs gingerly in high heels around a bend in the hallway. BOBBY has just stepped out of BEN’S office as LANA runs by him screaming. Feigning fear or danger, LANA only briefly looks at BOBBY as she runs past him. Baffled by the commotion, BOBBY just shakes his head.

As BOBBY starts to walk off, he is jerked back and the case with the camera falls to the floor. The strap had gotten caught on the door handle. BOBBY picks up the camera case and untangles the strap from the door handle.

COOPER’S POV:

Through DALE COOPER’S POV, we FOCUS on a manila folder with a photograph of a house pasted to it along with a description of the house, a realtor summary.

COOPER
Hmm ... I’d like to see both.

We PAN RIGHT to another folder with a picture of a house on it with another realtor summary.


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing beside the end of the long desk in the conference room of the building, COOPER, dressed in khakis and a plaid flannel shirt, mulls through two different house selections in his hands. A chalk sketch of the map of Twin Peaks on a black board is a backdrop. Standing near COOPER, IRENE LITTLEHORSE, a realtor, asks ...

IRENE
Very good, which one would you like to see first?

COOPER
Well.

COOPER places the folders on the table and reaches into his pants pocket to retrieve a coin. With a flick of his thumb he tosses the coin up.


INSERT: COIN

We FOCUS on the coin as it flips around in the air in SLOW MOTION. The coin falls and ricochets off a plate of donuts on the table. The coin skips on the table top and comes to a rest on a folder scattered near a bunch of folders near IRENE.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER picks up the folder that the coin came to rest on. He catches the coin in his left hand as it slides off the top of the folder.

COOPER
What is this?

IRENE
I thought I’d taken that out. That property is called Dead Dog Farm and its worse than it sounds.

COOPER
What is it?

IRENE
A puzzle, no one ever really stays there long.

COOPER

JUDIE
I’m Little Nicky’s case manager.

JUDIE extends a hand for greetings to DICK. DICK shakes her hand.

DICK
(smiles) Charmed I’m sure. Shall we?

JUDIE
Sit down. Okay (clears her throat.)

They all take a seat. JUDIE opens the folder she has been holding, pulls out several documents and hands them to DICK.

JUDIE
Uhm as I was about to tell your uh friends, the number one thing to know about Nicky is that throughout his brief life he has been very confused and perhaps traumatized by a persistent random misfortune.

DICK
Looks like he’s bounced around quite a bit.

JUDIE
Oh yeah, well yes he has.

LUCY
Poor child.

JUDIE
Yes, an orphan you know.

ANDY
Really, what happened did his parents die?

DICK

JUDIE
Uh they were killed.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

DICK
How were they killed Miss Swayne?

JUDIE
Uh mysterious circumstances. I’m afraid the uh orphanage has never provided us with that information.

SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN quickly steps out of his office that opens out to the waiting area of the reception room. As he puts on his jacket and hat, he calls out for ...

DR. HAYWARD
Looks like a heart attack.

DEPUTY ANDY, standing next to DR. HAYWARD, reads aloud from a book he found in the room.

ANDY
Once stimulated the female will respond in such a way that the skin around her ...

ANDY looks up from the book and over to TRUMAN.

ANDY
... oh my god.

ANDY moves the book over to DR. HAYWARD to show him the racy description.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Looks like Dougie went out with his boots on.

TRUMAN looks at the books on the bed and reads the titles out loud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Love poems of Lord Byron, the Kamasutra, Hookers and Handmaidens.

ANDY looks inside an open suitcase on the bed that is filled with fetish sex toys. ANDY picks up a translucent plastic mask from the suitcase, puts it over his face.

ANDY
Sheriff look at this.

ANDY turns to DR. HAYWARD, who is instantly repelled at the sight of the mask. ANDY removes the mask as he and DR. HAYWARD turn their attention to the door of the room as MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, DOUGIE’S brother, enters.

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   32K

Wearing a black suit and carrying a rain coat over his left arm, MILFORD walks up to the bed.

MAYOR MILFORD
Well the falling out was here.

Standing over his brother, MILFORD bemoans the loss.

MAYOR MILFORD

MILFORD touches his brother’s shoulder and his head. He looks down the bed and sees a book.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BOOK

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the book ‘My Secret Life’ by Chris Gerrfey. MILFORD picks the book up.


BACK TO SCENE:

MILFORD passes the book to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

MAYOR MILFORD
Here sheriff. This is it, the murder weapon. She might as well as blown his brains out with a rifle.

MILFORD picks up his brother’s hand and gently places it on top of his brother’s chest. As he pats his brother’s hand, MILFORD remarks ...

MAYOR MILFORD
He never could say no to a woman. You old fool.

MILFORD turns to leave. DEPUTY ANDY places an arm around MILFORD to comfort him as ANDY escorts him out of the room.




CUT TO:

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

Just outside DOUGIE’S hotel bedroom, DEPUTY TOMMY THE ‘HAWK’ HILL squats to the side of LANA MILFORD, who is seated in a chair, as he tries to comfort her. MAYOR MILFORD and DEPUTY ANDY step out of the bedroom and into the hall. DEPUTY HAWK stands up and grasps MILFORD’S left arm to help guide him. ANDY releases his hold and walks back into the bedroom. Spotting LANA, MILFORD points a finger at her.

MAYOR MILFORD
You sexual adventurous. You’ll burn in hell for this!

HAWK
Take it easy Mr. ...

Two nearby deputies, DEPUTY #1 and DEPUTY #2 grab an arm of MILFORD’S and slowly lead him up the hall away from LANA.

MAYOR MILFORD
I’m going to shout till ... to ... wake the dead ... she murdered my brother. She - she’s - she’s a witch.

The DEPUTIES lead MILFORD away. DEPUTY HAWK returns to a squat beside LANA and holds her hand to comfort her.

LANA
He’s right. I’m cursed.

HAWK
A curse needs a cure. I know a bit about these things.

LANA
Are you the sheriff?

HAWK
Let’s just say ...

HAWK boldly stands up and leans back on the door to DOUGIE’S bedroom.

HAWK
... when something really big goes down, I’m the man.

Suddenly the door to the bedroom opens and HAWK’S eyes widen as he loses his balance, falls to his left side and back into the bedroom. Perplexed, DEPUTY ANDY stands in the doorway and stares at LANA.

COACH (OFF SCREEN)
Boys, there’s a story about a great football coach, ...



CUT TO:

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Inside the Twin Peaks High School gymnasium, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the face of the WRESTLING COACH as he stands before students of the high school and tells them a story.

COACH
... whose name escapes me at this time, who was dead set against having a black players on his team. Until somebody brought him the finest black halfback anyone had ever seen. And when what’s his name saw him run fifty yards and no one lay a hand on him he shouted, ‘look at that indian go.’ That coach accepted that athlete’s desire to compete. Nadine.

We ZOOM OUT to see the WRESTLING COACH standing in the gymnasium. NADINE HURLEY, wearing a white Twin Peaks High School Physical Education T-shirt, quickly scampers down and stands beside the WRESTLING COACH.

COACH
Now today the story applies to this woman’s ... (corrects himself) this young girl’s right to compete. In addition to it being her moral and constitutional right. Mike Nelson, could you step up here for a second.

MIKE NELSON stands up from his seat on the bleachers and walks up to the WRESTING COACH. Several WRESTLERS, standing and seated on the wrestling mat, clap and cheer for MIKE.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Yeah ... ooh ... yeah get em’ killer ... come on Mike.

The COACH holds an arm over the shoulder’s of MIKE and NADINE as he boldly announces ...

COACH
Now Nadine has chosen to prove herself to us by taking on our very best. Our very own district champion, Mike Nelson.

The COACH tugs MIKE close.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Yeah ... come on ... oh-ho ... alright ... go Mike.

The WRESTLING COACH stands at the edge of the mat with a whistle in his mouth as he acts as the referee. Facing each other hunched over, MIKE and NADINE square off in the middle of the wrestling mat. MIKE reaches out, grabs NADINE by the back of the neck and pulls her towards him until the top of her head rests on his left shoulder.

NADINE
Hi Mike.

MIKE reaches out for NADINE’S right hand, grabs it and throws it on his back shoulder. NADINE slides her right hand over to his neck.

MIKE
Put your hand here.

MIKE grabs her right hand again and places it back on the back of his left shoulder.

MIKE
No here. Alright now just push against me. I’ll try not to hurt ya’.

MIKE and NADINE waddle together as they push each other around on the mat.

NADINE
Want to go out tonight?

MIKE
This is called a Tie Hand.

MIKE quickly releases his grip, moves behind NADINE, throws his arms around her waist and picks her up. MIKE looks over to his COACH, who appears disappointed by the move. Releasing his grip, NADINE reaches behind to her right, grabs a hold on MIKE and throws him down hard to the mat.

COACH
Oh yeah.

The WRESTLERS all mumble to themselves.

MIKE
You stupid ...

NADINE
What did you say Mike?

MIKE gets back up and moves back into a starting position by hunching over and extending his arms to grab NADINE. NADINE quickly grabs MIKE’S neck and places him in a headlock. She jerks him around slightly as she holds his neck tight.

MIKE
(straining) You’re breaking my neck.

NADINE
You’re right this is sort of like necking.

NADINE jerks MIKE and throws him down hard to the mat. MIKE stumbles on the ground as he looks over to his WRESTLING COACH. NADINE picks MIKE up from the floor to stand him up. She then gets a grip on his leg and his shirt and lifts him up into the air and over her head.

NADINE
What about tonight?

MIKE
Coach?

The WRESTLING COACH quietly stares in awe as he watches NADINE spin MIKE around in the air.

MIKE
Hey coach?

NADINE throws MIKE into the air and he falls hard onto the mat. Some of the WRESTLERS close their eyes with MIKE’S brutal collision with the floor.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Oh ... get up ... oh god.

NADINA pounces on MIKE’S chest and pins him to the mat. The COACH quickly walks up to the two and counts ...

COACH
One, two and three.

NADINE
Now will you go out with me?

NADINE gets up from MIKE. Pained, MIKE lifts his head up to look at NADINE and then drops it back to the mat.

COOPER and RILEY greet each other and shake hands.

COLONEL RILEY
Cooper. You were with Briggs when we lost our coordinates on him?

COOPER
Yes I was.

COLONEL RILEY
When you were at the sight did you notice any wildlife in the area?

COOPER
Wildlife?

COLONEL RILEY
Birds, owls ...?

COOPER
Yes, yes just moments before the Major disappeared I heard an owl.

MUSIC: HOLDING OUT   12K

COLONEL RILEY
Any visual contact?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Look Colonel, (RILEY turns to TRUMAN) Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine. Be a lot better if you’d just leveled with us.

COOPER
We know about the monitors and the messages from deep space that you received pertaining to me.

COLONEL RILEY
You may know something but ... you’d best get your facts straight. Our monitors are pointed at deep space but the messages we intercepted, that Briggs showed you, were sent from right here in these woods.

RILEY points to a position on a map on top of TRUMAN’S desk.

COLONEL RILEY
And where they were sent to is another question.

COOPER
Might this have something to do with a place called the white lodge?

COLONEL RILEY
That’s classified.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Colonel, we’d like to help you but you need to give us a little more to go on here.

Looking at TRUMAN, RILEY leans on TRUMAN’S desk.

COLONEL RILEY
Garland Briggs is the best pilot I’ve ever known. He was born with hardware most of us only dream about. I can tell you this, his disappearance has implications that go so far beyond national security ... the cold war seems like a case of the sniffles.

COOPER can only contemplate over COLONEL RILEY’S limited information.

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

AUDREY HORNE leans back against a wall in a corner of the hallway. BOBBY BRIGGS, dressed in a suit and carrying the leather camera case, walks into the corridor holding a manila envelope. BOBBY doesn’t notice AUDREY as he walks up the hallway. AUDREY quickly walks up behind him, moves around his right side (BOBBY looks over his left shoulder as he hears footsteps) and faces BOBBY.

AUDREY
(big smile) Well look who’s here. Did daddy have a change of heart?

BOBBY
Daddy just made the smartest decision that he’s made all year.

AUDREY
Oh yeah, that doesn’t say much. What’d he do?

BOBBY
He put me on the pay roll.

AUDREY slyly laughs as she playfully jabs BOBBY at his ribs.

AUDREY
Bobby, you junior achiever you.

AUDREY tugs at BOBBY’S arm. BOBBY stops walking, turns to AUDREY and holds before her the manila envelope he’s been carrying.

BOBBY
And uh this right here (manila envelope) this is my first assignment.

AUDREY
Ah, anything I can help you with?

AUDREY reaches out for the manila envelope but BOBBY whips it out of her reach and holds it behind his back.

BOBBY
Maybe. Maybe you could help me celebrate ...

BOBBY touches AUDREY’S cheek.

BOBBY

BOBBY shows AUDREY the envelope again.

AUDREY
Want to know what I think Bobby Briggs?

She reaches out for the envelope and BOBBY quickly slips it behind his back again.

BOBBY
Tell.

AUDREY grabs BOBBY’S suit collar.

AUDREY
I think ... that we should think ... about doing ... business ... together.

BOBBY moves his head towards AUDREY for a kiss but AUDREY moves aside. Missing the kiss and with his head bowed, BOBBY chuckles and then lifts his head back up. He points at AUDREY.

BOBBY
Audrey, I like the way you think.

BOBBY walks off.

AUDREY
Thank you.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

On top of BENJAMIN’S desk, in the center of the office, is a model of a hill complete with small trees and vegetation. A confederate flag on a flagpole stands next to the desk. From the top of the model hill, smoke billows up into the air. BOBBY walks into the office and up to the model.

BOBBY
Hey Mr. Horne, how’s it going?

BENJAMIN sits up from behind the model and places a tiny half-inch tall confederate soldier on the top of the hill on the model. Smoking a cigar, BEN is dressed in the gray uniform of a confederate soldier.

BOBBY
What uh ... is this that you’re doing here exactly?

BENJAMIN
Gettysburg, day one. The South is winning.

BOBBY
I followed Hank. I got those pictures you wanted.

BOBBY extends the manila envelope to BEN. BEN smiles as he puts a small bottle of glue and his cigar down and grabs the envelope. BEN opens the envelope and pulls out several large 8.5 inch by 11 inch photographs.

BOBBY
You see, I - I don’t know what he’s up to but I’m sure its no good.

AUDREY’S POV:

From AUDREY’S POV looking through the knot hole in the office wall, we see BENJAMIN standing next to BOBBY as they look through the photographs.

BOBBY
Well I - I like you too.

BENJAMIN
How much am I paying you?

We FOCUS on AUDREY as she stands close to the wall looking through the small knot hole into the office and listening in on BEN’S conversation.

BOBBY (OFF SCREEN)
Uh well - well we haven’t actually discussed money.


AUDREY’S POV:

From AUDREY’S POV looking through the knot hole in the wall, we see BENJAMIN reach into his confederate uniform jacket pocket and pull out a wad of cash. BEN passes several bills to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Uh huh, well consider this your first raise. Now you come back tomorrow and we will discuss a full time position.

BEN salutes BOBBY and then returns to looking at the photographs. Elated, BOBBY smiles and pats BEN on the back.

BOBBY
Thank you. Ben, I won’t let you down.

BOBBY walks off.

PETE MARTELL, wearing a dark blue robe, and CATHERINE MARTELL, wearing a fine white lace robe, are seated across from each other at the dining room table. PETE opens a bottle of champagne and the cork pops off and ricochets off the ceiling.

CATHERINE
Ooh.

PETE
Nectar of the gods my dear.

PETE pours the champagne into tall, thin champagne glasses. CATHERINE smiles lovingly at PETE. They both stare into each other’s eyes. CATHERINE lifts her glass to her lips. PETE holds his glass up to CATHERINE.

PETE
Its the bubbles.

CATHERINE abstains from drinking as she listens to PETE recite ...

PETE
Wine comes in at the mouth. Love comes in at the eye. I touch my glass to my lips. I look at you and sigh.

CATHERINE
(smiling brightly) Thank you Pete. That’s very lyrical.

PETE
Its Yates.

CATHERINE downs her glass of champagne.

PETE
He’s a poet.

CATHERINE
Yes, I know.

PETE
The only other toast I know was a limerick.

CATHERINE fills her empty glass.

CATHERINE
No really, really Pete that was very touch- ...

CATHERINE quickly cuts him off ...

CATHERINE

In the nearby kitchen, JOSIE PACKARD, dressed in a maid’s outfit, stops her work as she prepares the meal and walks over to the dining room table.

JOSIE
Yes.

CATHERINE
We’ll have our appetizers now.

Buzzed from the champagne, PETE smiles contently.

JOSIE
Yes.

CATHERINE
Oh Josie, I just want you to know that even though your station in this household has changed I intend to show you all the respect and affection that you deserve.

JOSIE
Thank you Catherine ... and I’ll try to do the same.

JOSIE turns around to return to the kitchen.

CATHERINE
Oh and put on your little maid’s cap.

JOSIE turns to face CATHERINE, grabs her little maid’s cap off of the corner of the kitchen island counter and places it on her head. Before she returns to the kitchen, JOSIE smirks with a tilt to her head that shifts her maid’s cap.

PETE
Catherine, don’t you think maybe you’re being a little hard on her? I mean she is still part of the family.

CATHERINE
Josie had a hand in Andrew’s death and she did everything in her power to destroy me. She’s lucky she not hanging from a tree.

PETE
(shrugs) I don’t believe it. Not the Josie I know.

PETE stares into the bottom of his glass. CATHERINE lifts her glass up.

CATHERINE
I would like to propose a toast to Ben Horne’s double cross, here’s to Josie Packard’s dirty deeds and here’s to the woman who brought them down. Here’s to me.

PETE and CATHERINE touch glasses for the toast.

BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on COOPER sitting on his bed as he speaks into his mini-tape recorder.

COOPER
... printed in the personal columns per my instructions, but I’ve already received his response to this ... yesterday. He anticipated my response to his opening move perfectly. He’s toying with my Diane. I wonder where he is, what he’s planning. Meanwhile I’ve spent the past two days without badge and gun the best way I know how; occupying both body and spirit. Looked into some real estate, what the local agent charitably refers to as a fixer upper. None the less its the kind of place where a man might make a home, raise a family. Which is something, in spite of my past, I still hope I’m able to do. However, as is the case here in Twin Peaks, even this bucolic hideaway is filled with secrets. Secrets that may be connected to my trouble at the bureau and the cocaine that was found in my automobile. Agent Hardy’s deliberations will soon be completed and if I’m not adequately able to defend myself there’s a very real possibility of imprisonment.

COOPER stops recording.


COOPER’ POV:

Through COOPER’S POV, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER’S hands as he holds his mini-tape recorder in his left hand and a Bookhouse Boy’s patch, a round white patch with a pine tree and sword overlapping each other, in his right hand.


BACK TO SCENE:

There’s a KNOCK at the door. Sitting near the nightstand at the head of his bed, COOPER stands up to answer the door. He puts his mini-tape recorder in his flannel shirt pocket. COOPER opens the door to reveal AUDREY carrying a manila envelope.

AUDREY
Hello Agent Cooper.

COOPER
Audrey?

AUDREY walks inside. COOPER closes the door and walks up to her.

AUDREY
This is for you. I stole it.

COOPER
Don’t you think you better give it back?

AUDREY
Not until you look at what’s inside.

COOPER smiles.

COOPER
Okay.

He grabs the manila envelope from AUDREY.

COOPER
What am I going to find in here Audrey?

AUDREY
Pictures my father paid for.

COOPER opens the envelope and pulls out several large black and white photographs.


COOPER’S POV:

Through COOPER’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the black and white photographs. The photograph is taken from outside the Dead Dog Farm house where a group of four men, ERNIE NILES, HANK JENNINGS, RMCP PRESTON KING, and JEAN RENAULT, huddle together in a meeting. COOPER flips to the next photograph which is a zoom in shot of the meeting.

AUDREY takes a seat on a chair near the window.

AUDREY

There’s a knock at the door. COOPER moves over to the door to answer it. He opens the door to reveal DEA SPECIAL AGENT DENISE BRYSON, wearing a dark suit jacket and a skirt, standing in the hall.

COOPER
Denise.

DENISE
Hi Coop.

COOPER
Come in.

COOPER hugs DENISE in the doorway. AUDREY stares in shock at the exchange between the two.

DENISE walks inside and COOPER closes the door. Surprised, off guard and even slightly jealous AUDREY asks ...

AUDREY
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

COOPER introduces DENISE to AUDREY ...

COOPER
Special Agent Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency. (gestures to AUDREY) This is a very good friend of mine, Audrey Horne.

AUDREY rises from her chair and walks over to DENISE. DENISE offers a hand to shake in greeting. AUDREY shakes hands with DENISE.

AUDREY
They have women agents?

DENISE
More or less.

AUDREY stares at DENISE in admiration. COOPER, standing next to DENISE, smiles at the reaction of the two.

COOPER
Audrey if you’ll excuse us, agency business.

AUDREY
I - I thought you were suspended?

COOPER
I am. Thanks again, good night.

AUDREY puts her hands on her hips as she continues to look at DENISE in awe. DENISE responds in kind, with hands at hips.

AUDREY

BACK TO SCENE:

As DENISE looks at the photographs, COOPER reaches over to the top of a dresser for the plastic envelope filled with the cocaine evidence he found at Dead Dog Farm. COOPER holds the plastic envelope in front of him as he explains ...

COOPER
In the kitchen I found traces of cocaine in a baby laxative used to step it out. I think if you compare this which is taken from the farm with the stuff found from my automobile you find it to be a match.

DENISE grabs the plastic envelope, looks it over and turns to COOPER.

DENISE
That’s good news Coop.

COOPER
Yeah.

DENISE
Now can we talk about something more important?

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (W/O SAX)

DENISE

COOPER grabs DENISE’S left arm and leads to the door.

COOPER
Denise, I would assume you were no longer interested in girls?

COOPER opens the door.

DENISE
Coop I may be wearing a dress ... but I still put my panties on one leg at a time.

Standing near the open door, DENISE cups COOPER’S neck with a left hand.

DENISE
If you know what I mean.

DENISE walks out of the room.

COOPER
Not really.

COOPER closes the door and shakes his head at DENISE’S odd remark.

Dwayne, Dougie died of natural causes, heart attack. No evidence of foul play.

MAYOR MILFORD
Hmm-hmm, did you check him for witchcraft?

DR. HAYWARD
That’s uh not the kind of thing that shows up in an autopsy.

DR. HAYWARD stands up straight.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now Dwayne you know I can’t press charges if there hasn’t been a crime.

MAYOR MILFORD
Well she ... killed him with sex.

DR. HAYWARD silently laughs.

MAYOR MILFORD

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Dwayne its been a long, hard day why don’t you just go home and try to get some rest.

TRUMAN looks at DR. HAYWARD, who has covered his mouth to keep from laughing.

Oh she doth teach the torches to burn bright.

Seeing that the commotion if over LANA, LUCY rolls her eyes and walks back to her office.

DICK
It seems she hangs against the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear.

GROUP
Beauty to rich for use. For Earth too dear.

HAWK turns to look at LANA, who beguilingly leans back against the doorframe. Unaware that she was there, HAWK gives the four in the reception area a dirty look. HAWK turns to LANA, nods at her, caresses her left arm and leads her back into the conference room.

LUCY
Hmm.

LUCY walks out of her office and up to the closed door to SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office. She leans her head to the door and listens to LANA’S voice.

LANA (OFF SCREEN)

Tell us another one, please Lana. One more.

LUCY becomes aghast at the site of DEPUTY ANDY sitting in a corner of the room. With his hands clumped together, ANDY stares at LANA with an enchanted yearning look on his face. ANDY stands up, grabs a pitcher of milk (sitting atop of TRUMAN’S desk), and fills a glass.

LANA
This one time I had this cousin who was a clown in this rodeo, you know, and they just had all these really big horses, you know, and you will not believe what they made him do.

GROUP
(several) What?

ANDY passes the glass of milk to LANA.

LANA
They made him, thank you.

LANA grabs the glass of milk and sets it down on the desk in front of her.

LANA
They made him stand in the middle and take his clown costume completely off.

Ignored and jealous, LUCY bites her lip, takes a step back out of the TRUMAN’S office and SLAMS the door shut.

We FOCUS on the WOMAN’S feet as she walks next to and then stops at ERNIE’S booth.


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on the face of the WOMAN standing next to ERNIE’S booth - it is AGENT DENISE. DENISE takes a seat opposite ERNIE at his booth. Puzzled, ERNIE looks around the diner and then asks ...

ERNIE
Can I help you?

Sitting cross-legged on the corner of the bench seat, DENISE holds up the black and white photographs received from COOPER.

DENISE
Mr. Niles I don’t want to put the squeeze on you.

DENISE places the pictures on the table and slides them over to ERNIE.

DENISE
You’ve been to prison. I don’t need to paint you any pictures.

DENISE flashes a DEA badge. ERNIE picks the photographs up and looks at them.

ERNIE
What’s this all about?

DENISE
For starters, you’re guilty of a serious parole violation.

DENISE grabs a compact mirror from the purse, opens the compact mirror and looks into it.

DENISE
Ah.

DENISE grabs a lipstick from the purse.

DENISE
Enough to put you back inside.

DENISE applies lipstick and continues to add ...

DENISE
Now unless you cooperate I intend to do everything in my power to (finished with lipstick, smiles) make sure you stay there.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A fierce rain storm causes the lights to flicker and the room goes dark momentarily as blue lightning, which flashes the interior as thunder rumbles, disrupts the power service. We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of ERNIE’S face as he confesses ...

ERNIE
My name is Ernie Niles and I confess. I’m guilty.

The room grows dark as another bolt of lightning disrupts the power and flashes the room with blue light. Thunder pounds outside and power returns to the interior.

ERNIE
I guess I’m terribly guilty. Against my will of course.

Again the room becomes dark and lightning washes blue light into the room. Thunder rumbles outside. The interior lights return.

DENISE (OFF SCREEN)
Mr. Niles were not really interested in all that ...

We slowly ZOOM OUT and PAN RIGHT.

ERNIE
They held me at gun point. They beat me. They threatened me with physical violence. These men are animals they’ll stop at nothing.

COOPER stands next to the left of ERNIE. Bright blue lightning flashes outside.

COOPER
Mr. Niles just ...

ERNIE
They wanted me to sell drugs for them. I tried to resist but my family means everything to me.

The room becomes dark. Thunder rumbles and lightning flashes from the window. The lights in the room return. We slowly ZOOM OUT further.

ERNIE
They threatened my family and when they threatened my wife well I weakened you know. Look I’m terribly terribly sorry. I guess I did wrong but love ... love makes a guy do foolish things, you know, illegal things.

ERNIE is sitting on a chair near the foot of the bed. DENISE sits on the log wood bed railing at the foot of the bed next to the right of ERNIE. COOPER sits on the corner of a short dresser.

DENISE
Ernie Ernie Ernie, will you shut up.

With the sound of pouring rain outside, the lights go out as lightning once again disrupts the power momentarily.

COOPER
Mr. Niles we appreciate the trials you’ve been through. We sympathize with you.

ERNIE
You do?

COOPER
That’s why we’re here.

ERNIE
Oh - oh you are?

DENISE puts a hand on ERNIE’S right shoulder.

DENISE
Yes, now tell us everything you know.

The lights go out and then return again as they are disrupted by a bright flash of lightning followed by crashing thunder.

ERNIE
Yes Mrs. uh ... well they tortured me and the thing was that they’re filthy, horrible, disgusting ...

DENISE shrugs in disappointment. The lights briefly dim. Lightning flashes in the window.

COOPER
Mr. Niles please, just the information pertaining to the selling of drugs if you please.

ERNIE
Oh that yeah, yeah well they got uhm ... 4 kilos of cocaine to sell so uh ... they’re looking for a buyer.

The intense storm darkens the room once more. Bright blue light illuminates the interior and a loud boom of thunder roars. After a short duration in the dark, the lights return to normal.

ERNIE
So to protect my family I uh told them I’d go find one.

COOPER
Have you?

ERNIE
Oh me (laughs) are you kidding I don’t know anybody that would do anything like that.

ERNIE cowers in his seat. DENISE reaches out and picks up ERNIE’S right hand.

DENISE
You do now.

Another close bolt of lightning shuts the power down and flashes the interior. After a quake of thunder, the power returns.

DENISE caresses ERNIE’S hand. ERNIE stares nervously at his hand and at DENISE.

DENISE
A major drug trafficker will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.

COOPER stands up and paces the floor behind ERNIE.

DENISE
You will set up a meet with these men at the Dead Dog Farm.

ERNIE
I will? How will I uh ...

The lights momentarily go out. Lightning flashes and thunder growls.

ERNIE
... how will I know him?

COOPER stops and looks at DENISE’S and ERNIE’S reaction.

DENISE
You’re looking at him.

ERNIE jerks his hand out of DENISE’S grasp and looks at DENISE’S dress.

ERNIE
Him?

DENISE pats ERNIE on the right shoulder. ERNIE’S reaction generates a smile on DENISE’S face. ERNIE stands up.

ERNIE
Excuse me, I’ve got a nervous bladder.

COOPER watches ERNIE walk off to the bathroom.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
You know something ...

Lightning flashes the room with blue light. JAMES turns to MALCOLM.

JAMES
Is she gonna be okay?

MALCOLM
The first time he beat her I swore revenge, something violent and noble.

Standing in the doorway, MALCOLM looks back into the other room.

MALCOLM
She beg me not to hurt him, made me promise, said it was for both our sakes.

MALCOLM leans on the door jamb and looks back at JAMES.

MALCOLM
That was four years ago. One day I’ll swear I’ll kill him. No matter what it costs.

MALCOLM turns around and walks off. JAMES watches him leave and then turns to face the window just as a very bright flash of lightning illuminates the room.

CUT TO:

INT. BRIGGS HOUSE - NIGHT

Situated in the dark interior of the living room, we FOCUS on a window far at the end of the dining room. A FIGURE sits in the dark on a couch in the living room. Lightning flashes outside and illuminates the interior as the front door, to the left, opens. BOBBY walks into the house and across the room. The FIGURE watches BOBBY enter and moves to turn on a nearby lamp. Spooked, BOBBY jumps slightly and turns to see his mother, ELIZABETH BRIGGS, wearing a light blue robe, sitting on the couch.

BOBBY
Geez Ma give me a heart attack.

The base of the lamp, on top of the endtable next to ELIZABETH, is a large ceramic white owl.

ELIZABETH
I’m sorry.

BOBBY
What are you doing here sitting alone in the dark?

BOBBY places his car keys on a nearby table. He walks up to his mother and brushes his hair back with both hands.

ELIZABETH
Nothing, just sitting here.

BOBBY squats down and kneels just to the side of, but facing, his mother.

BOBBY
Well read a book or something mom, its creepy.

Holding a Kleenex tissue in her hands, ELIZABETH tries to hold a smile but she bows her head and lets out a whimper.

BOBBY
(concerned) Its dad right?

ELIZABETH quietly nods for yes. Thunder crackles for an extend time.

BOBBY
He’ll be back. You know he will. This is just some of that top secret jazz.

ELIZABETH
I’m not so sure this time.

BOBBY reaches into his shirt pocket and grabs a packet of cigarettes. He quickly jerks the packet in his hands to dispel a cigarette that he grabs with his lips.

ELIZABETH looks out towards the window in the dining room as lightning flashes and thunder loudly rattles nearby.

BOBBY grabs his lighter and, with a flick of the wrist, opens it. He lights his cigarette and holds it aside.

BOBBY
I was at the Double R a couple of weeks ago, Dad and I, we ... had this talk ...

MUSIC: VISION OF YOU

BOBBY
... about this dream he had. It was a big house made of white marble and lots of lights. Dad was there and I was there too.

ELIZABETH smiles as she listens to BOBBY’S recall of the dream.

BOBBY
Living a life of deep harmony and joy, or something like that, and there was all this stuff about my future, good stuff.

The room goes dark as a bolt of lightning interferes with the power service. Bright blue light flashes the dark interior. With the rumble of thunder the lights return.

BOBBY
Kinda’ nuts ... but I think he’s cool.

ELIZABETH
Your father is an extraordinary human being.

BOBBY takes a drag on his cigarette.

BOBBY
My father is a deeply weird individual, but he has a lot more going ...

BOBBY taps the side of his head.

BOBBY
... on in his head than most people that’s for sure.

ELIZABETH peers up as she recounts ...

ELIZABETH
Sometimes when I’m sleeping ... he runs his fingers through my hair ...

Lightning flashes outside and thunder rustles. BOBBY reaches out and holds his mother’s left hand. ELIZABETH becomes upset and lets out a small cry as she recounts the memory of her husband.

ELIZABETH
... and he thinks I don’t notice that.

The lights go out. Thunder crackles as a bright flash of blue light from a bolt of lightning illuminates the interior. ELIZABETH looks to her left, into the dining room, and is stunned by the sight of a FIGURE standing in the dark. Noting her reaction, BOBBY turns to look over his shoulder.

Another bolt of lightning brightens the dark interior and illuminates the FIGURE - its MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, dressed in a World War II aviator outfit.

MAJOR BRIGGS
How long have I been gone?

ELIZABETH
Two days.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Strange, it seemed much shorter.

The lights return as power is restored. MAJOR BRIGGS removes the aviator cap and a white scarf around his neck. ELIZABETH jumps up from her seat and rushes over to hug MAJOR BRIGGS. The two embrace each other. MAJOR BRIGGS kisses her cheek.

ELIZABETH
Garland oh!

Stunned, BOBBY stands up. The lights flicker along with a crack of thunder. MAJOR BRIGGS looks at BOBBY.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby I want you to put out that cigarette.

BOBBY looks at the cigarette he holds in his left hand. He quickly turns around and puts it out into an ash tray on the coffee table. Wide-eyed, BOBBY walks up to his dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Then I’d like you to fix me a cocktail. A strong one if you don’t mind.

BOBBY
Sure dad.

BOBBY walks off to fetch the drink. MAJOR BRIGGS and ELIZABETH still hold each other. They kiss. Lightning flashes.

ELIZABETH
Is everything alright?

My husband died in a fire. No one can know my sorrow. My love is gone. Yet, I feel him near me. Sometimes I can almost see him. At night when the wind blows, I think of what he might have been. Again I wonder: why? When I see a fire, I feel my anger rising. This was not a friendly fire. This was not a forest fire. It was a fire in the woods. This is all I am permitted to say.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape in the dark, then nothing. Till I found myself standing by the cold remains of our campfire, two days later.

DR. HAYWARD (OFF SCREEN)
(distorted speech) Major, there are some new techniques that might help us break through your amnesia.

MAJOR BRIGGS
My memories are immune from regression uh ... I can feel them: palatable, the smells, the sensation. Everything is known to me yet somehow beyond my reach.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)

Very little, save for one disturbing image of ... a giant owl, vervasive.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
A giant owl? How big?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Enough to cloud my mind and memory.

MAJOR BRIGGS, wearing his military uniform, is seated at the end of the long conference table with his hat lying on the table before him. With a chalk sketch of the map of the town of Twin Peaks as a backdrop on a blackboard, MAJOR BRIGGS nervously twiddles with his hands and stares off into the distance as he attempts to recall his incident. DALE COOPER, wearing a flannel shirt and khakis, stands to the left of MAJOR BRIGGS and DR. WILL HAYWARD, holding a Polaroid camera and a developing photograph, stands to the right of MAJOR BRIGGS. DR. HAYWARD walks over to COOPER and hands him the photograph.

DR. HAYWARD
Three triangular scars behind the right ear in perfect proportion.

DR. HAYWARD places the camera down on the corner of the table. COOPER puts the photograph on the table. Next to COOPER, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN sits on the edge of the tabletop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Major Briggs, exactly what does your work involve?

COOPER sits down at the table and leans over crossed arms to MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
That information ... as I’ve repeated innocently to myself, classified. Keeping secrets ... means less meaningful to me now.

MAJOR BRIGGS becomes more animated as he speaks with his hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Perhaps there are sources of information that’s no longer important, that can transcend the need to conspire. Information of such weight that pertains not ...

MAJOR BRIGGS trembles, touches the tabletop using the index and pinky fingers on his left hand and looks at COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS
... oh god ... is this meant for the soul ... my soul?

Puzzled, TRUMAN stares at MAJOR BRIGGS. COOPER looks down at the table in contemplation. Still trembling slightly, MAJOR BRIGGS rubs his hands together.

COOPER
Major, perhaps you better start back at the beginning?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Are you familiar with project Blue Book?

COOPER
Yes sir I am, the Air Force investigation into the phenomena of unidentified flying objects.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Officially it disbanded in 1969, but there are those of us who ... continue an unofficial capacity, examining the heavens as before. In the case of Twin Peaks the Earth below.

MAJOR BRIGGS gestures downward with his left hand. COOPER and TRUMAN look at each other, exchanging awareness from the information revealed by MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We are searching for a place called the white lodge ...

MAJOR BRIGGS stops short of his thought as the door to conference room opens. MAJOR BRIGGS sits quietly and upright as two military policemen, M.P. #1 and M.P. #2, walk into the room.

M.P. #1
Major Briggs.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’ve been expecting you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now hold on just a minute fellows.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up, walks up to MAJOR BRIGGS and stands between him and the M.P.'S.

M.P. #1
Colonel Reilly’s orders.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t care what orders you got this is my station and Major Briggs happens to be a friend of mine ...

As a friendly gesture, SHERIFF TRUMAN rests a hand on MAJOR BRIGGS left shoulder. MAJOR BRIGGS pats TRUMAN'S wrist for restraint.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Harry.

COOPER and MAJOR BRIGGS stand up.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m afraid we’ll will have to continue this discussion at a later date.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Are you sure you want to go with them?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yeah, goodbye.

MAJOR BRIGGS pats TRUMAN'S left arm and then walks out of the room with the two M.P.'S. DR. HAYWARD and SHERIFF TRUMAN watch MAJOR BRIGGS leave. COOPER turns to the photograph lying on the table. TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD turn toward the table and quietly look at each other before they turn their attention to COOPER as he picks up the photograph.


COOPER'S POV:

Through COOPER'S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a Polaroid photograph taken of MAJOR BRIGGS' neck. Behind the ear is a reddish-brown scar of three triangles joined at one point, similar to the emblem for a radiation hazard.

Drops of water fall onto the photograph.

Sitting in a chair facing the phone, ERNIE NILES nervously reaches out for the phone but quickly pulls back. Standing by the window behind ERNIE, DEA AGENT DENISE BRYSON keeps an eye on ERNIE while using a finger nail file.

DENISE
Oh go ahead Ernie. It won’t bite.

ERNIE
A lot you know pal. These men are dangerous thugs. Not that I haven’t met plenty of their kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man but I’ve known men that would make him quiver.

From behind, DENISE walks up to ERNIE and pats his shoulders.

DENISE
Ernie, come on, make the call.

DENISE cradles ERNIE'S neck with a right hand. Annoyed, ERNIE wiggles out of DENISE'S grasp.

The door to SHERIFF TRUMAN'S office opens and COOPER pokes his head inside. Holding a cup of coffee, COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Well, have we set the buy yet?

DENISE
Trying to. Ernie’s a wee bit gun shy.

ERNIE
Gun shy! Ernie Nile’s is as bold as can be, let me at him.

ERNIE boldly picks up the receiver and punches the buttons with his index finger as he dials the phone number. COOPER steps into the room and closes the door behind himself. ERNIE cups the mouth of the receiver and cowers ...

ERNIE
Please, don’t make do this. This is suicide I know please I’m begging you please for everybody’s sake please.

COOPER
Ernie - Ernie - Ernie.

COOPER walks up to the desk next to ERNIE, lifts the plate of donuts up and takes a seat on the desktop where the plate of donuts was resting. COOPER picks up a donut from the top of the stack and is alarmed at the sight of a bite taken out of it. Holding the donut, COOPER glares at ERNIE.

ERNIE
Hello. (reply) May I speak to Jean Renault please.

COOPER puts the bitten donut back on the plate, grabs another donut and takes a bite. Still standing behind ERNIE, DENISE runs a hand through ERNIE'S hair. Irked, ERNIE flinches and squirms in his chair.

ERNIE
Hi Jean, yeah I’ve got that big out of town buy here.

With his mouth full, COOPER grins and gives ERNIE a big thumbs up sign.

Wearing sunglasses, EVELYN MARSH quietly glides through the open split door of the garage and leans against one of the closed doors as she listens in on JAMES'S telephone conversation.

BIG ED
(over the phone) Where are you? You alright?

JAMES
Oh I’m okay. Uh look I need a favor. Uhm I need you to get all the money out of my savings account.

BIG ED (OFF SCREEN)
(over the phone) That’s only twelve dollars James.

Well whatever’s left and send in care of me to Walley’s, its this bar on I-96.

(straight up) No.

EVELYN
Tell me about Twin Peaks.

JAMES
There’s nothing to say.

EVELYN walks up to JAMES.

EVELYN
You could start with why you left. Its a woman as I recall. No you said it was a few of them.

JAMES
I loved a girl who died. Her name was Laura. I thought I knew her but I didn’t. I guess nobody did.

EVELYN
I’m sorry.

JAMES
My life used to make sense, you know. I didn’t like it all the time but it ... was mine, and I felt like it belonged to me. And then, and then Laura died ... and my life belonged to something else, to Laura.

JAMES walks away from EVELYN.

JAMES
And no matter what I did, no matter how much I tried to help, another girl got murdered. And I just wanted to get on my bike and ride away, take off and just go as far from Twin Peaks as the day will take me.

EVELYN walks up to JAMES. JAMES turns to face her.

EVELYN
I know the feeling James.

EVELYN holds JAMES'S chin.

EVELYN
I know the feeling.

JAMES cocks his head to the side and they kiss each other. JAMES runs his hand through her hair and then removes her wide rim sunglasses to reveal a bruised eye.

JAMES
(gently) Why do you let him hurt you?

EVELYN silences JAMES with a kiss.

A car can be heard pulling up outside the garage. EVELYN quickly turns her head to look outside.

EVELYN

MALCOLM SLOAN can be heard outside of the garage.

Reading a newspaper with a cup of coffee before him, MIKE NELSON, wearing his red and white Twin Peaks high school letterman jacket, sits alone at the island counter. NADINE HURLEY, dressed in a red and white Twin Peaks high school cheerleader outfit, walks up to MIKE.

NADINE
Good morning Mike Nelson.

NADINE takes a seat next to MIKE at the counter. MIKE turns to NADINE, becomes agitated and then quickly turns back.

MIKE
Oh lord.

MIKE tosses his paper aside and rubs his forehead in frustration.

NADINE
You wanna share a soda? How about a nice, big piece of cherry pie, two forks?

MIKE
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine I want my own piece of cherry pie. In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie by myself.

NADINE
Okay.

NADINE stares longingly at MIKE. MIKE reaches out for his cup of coffee but stops short as NADINE blurts out ...

NADINE
Meatloaf?

MIKE faces NADINE and speaks with his hands as he retorts ...

MIKE
No, cherry pie and coffee. In fact, I want sixteen cups of coffee. I don’t want to talk with you, I don’t want to walk with you, I don’t want to see you, I don’t want to know you. Is that clear enough to understand? Or do I need a court order to get my point across.

Heavyhearted, NADINE looks down at the island counter.

NADINE
Mike Nelson, you are the handsomest boy I’ve ever known, (looks up at MIKE) and I would really like it if you and I could go out on a date.

Surprised, MIKE slumps back in his chair. NADINE reaches out with both hands, clasps MIKE'S head and kisses him. As NADINE continues to kiss MIKE she attracts the attention of some of the diners in the restaurant as she pushes him back until he is lying down on the next seat.

NADINE
I’m sorry, sometimes I can’t help myself.

NADINE lifts herself off of MIKE. MIKE grasps the island countertop to help lift himself up. Flustered and enthralled, MIKE looks around the diner.

We FOCUS on NORMA as she walks out of the kitchen and puts on a blue overcoat as she enters the island counter service area.

TRUMAN releases his grip, spins JOSIE around to face him and cradles her jaw with his hands. They look into each other's eyes and then kiss.

JOSIE touches TRUMAN'S jaw and pushes him away.

JOSIE pushes TRUMAN'S hands away from their embrace on her jaw.

With desire in their eyes, TRUMAN bends his head down and kisses JOSIE.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I want you.

TRUMAN brushes kisses on JOSIE'S lips as he slowly pushes her forward and up against a kitchen wall. As their passion grows, JOSIE runs her hands over his back and then cradles her arms around his neck. After a long and intense smooch, TRUMAN looks deeply into JOSIE'S eyes and then, as he holds her close, kisses her on her forehead. TRUMAN then returns to stroke kisses across JOSIE'S lips.

LUCY
Well it turned out to be a transformer up a pole, right behind and above the building. Well we had to wait before we could come back inside ...

COOPER walks into the reception room, lights up the cigarette lighter and holds it up to view the interior.

LUCY

Cooper drops the chess piece in a bag and hands it to ANDY standing inside the door with his eyes closed so he won't see the body and cry. He reaches out for the bag, misses it. Truman puts it in Andy's hand. Andy turns to leave and walks into to the wall with a thud. Andy peeks, adjusts his trajectory and makes it.

TRUMAN
How long has he been dead, Doc?

HAYWARD
Hard to tell; we'll need an autopsy.

COOPER
Doc, open the victim's shirt. I believe you will find an
incision, a stab wound one inch beneath the sternum,
penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.

No blood stains.

Cooper picks a pine needle up off the floor. Then walks to the middle windowsill, examines with magnifier. HAWK comes in the door.

COOPER
Hawk, footprints?

HAWK
Two sets, same boots; one coming, one leaving. Heavier
impressions on the way down.

COOPER
Carrying the body.

TRUMAN
We should get molds made of those before it rains.

COOPER
He'll have been wearing the wrong size shoe, untraceable
and already destroyed.

HAWK
I followed them to the granite stream up the ridge, lost
them on the rocks.

COOPER
He knows how to mask a trail ... any cars stolen in town
recently?

TRUMAN
There was one a couple of days ago, from the Cash and
Carry on Sparkwood. No witnesses. Cooper, you're
sure Windom Earle's behind this?

Cooper nods, steps to the window, looks into the darkness.

COOPER
A short time ago, a vagrant ... our victim was befriended
and offered a lift. He was given some cheap wine and a
cigarette. The victim was then driven to a location up
behind the ridge, you'll find the car still up there. He
was stabbed, once, managed to run at least fifty yards,
cutting his hands and face on brush before collapsing.
Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power
failure, created the diversionary fire that drew everyone
outside the station, then brought the body in through this
window.
(turns, Faces them)
Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his
presence. There aren't going to be any fingerprints in
here, Harry. No slip-ups, oversights, no mistakes.
Everything he does has its own rationale, precision and
intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken
his first pawn. In a very sick game.

3. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT

AUDREY and BOBBY sit at a small round table. The power is out. Candlelight illuminates the scene. They have drinks between them. Plus a bucket of ice. Audrey drops a few cubes into Bobby's glass and a few into hers.

AUDREY
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs, here's what we're gonna
do. If I have learned anything from my father before he
flipped his wig it's that a business relationship is a
sacred pact, equaled only by the closest of personal
relationships ... where nothing is held back.

BOBBY
Right.

AUDREY
Do you want to get rich, Bobby?

BOBBY
Immediately.

AUDREY
Maybe I can help. This is the last of the ice cubes till the
power comes back on.

She reaches over and picks an ice cube out of Bobby's drink.

AUDREY
Now, pretend this is my father.

She closes her hand around it.

BOBBY
An ice cube?

AUDREY
Right. And our job now is to help my father find his
way back from Limbo-Land so he doesn't melt away and
leave me with a handful of nothing.

She reopens her hand, the cube is melted.

AUDREY
We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?

BOBBY
No.

AUDREY
From now on Bobby I'm the one you suck up to.

She licks up the melted water.

BOBBY
(a moment of conscience)
What about Shelly?

AUDREY
What about Shelly?

Bobby's eyes grow stalks. He finishes his drink.

5. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

POV, moving frantically through the darkened kitchen into the living room and to the door. We pull back, SHELLY desperately tries to open the door but it's been locked from the out side.

SHELLY
(screaming)
No!

She looks back into the kitchen, it's pitch black, she can't see a thing.

SHELLY
(pleading)
Oh, God ... please no.

The sound of a creaking wheel on the wheelchair is heard.

SHELLY
Leo?

Out of the darkness comes Leo's wheelchair directly toward her, it knocks over a lamp, comes closer and closer. She jumps out of the way as it crashes into the door. Shelly starts for a window, something flies through the air and lands at her feet. She freezes; a bar of soap in a sock lays on the floor. A guttural laugh rises out of the darkness.

SHELLY
Don't do this, Leo.

From the darkness comes.

LEO
(slurred, and bursting with pride that he's e's back)
Le...O. Le...O.

The refrigerator door swings open. The light from inside illuminates a grinning crazed- looking LEO.

LEO
F-u-n-s o-v-e-r.

Leo laughs again. The refrigerator slowly closes. From the darkness comes the sound of a foot dragging across the floor. Shelly makes a break for it, out of the darkness Leo's hand grabs Shelly by the neck, pulls her close to him.

LEO
Le-o go-od.

He smiles, then throws her across the table, sending her and everything on the table crashing into the corner.

LEO
Fu-n.

Leo shuffles toward Shelly, his left leg and arm not quite up to snuff. He stops, reaches up and turns on the radio.

LEO
Le-o like mu-sic.

Shelly picks up a toaster and hurls it at him, bouncing it off his chest. Leo looks at the toaster, then down at his chest.

LEO
Ow.

Shelly tries to run again, no luck, Leo has her, grabs her by the throat. He starts to spin her around, his grip tightening on her throat as he does. Shelly tries to pull away, but even with only one good arm Leo it too much, desperately close to passing out she strikes, gouging at his eyes. Leo erupts in a rage, throws her into the living room where she crashes against the wall. Leo then flips the kitchen table over and lets out an animal like howl.

8. EXT. LEO'S - NIGHT

Bobby tries the door but it won't open, then bangs on it.

BOBBY
Shelly? Shelly?

Bobby walks over to the window and looks in, rubs on the glass to get a clearer view. Shelly pulls herself up to the glass, bruised and crying.

BOBBY
(immediate concern)
Shelly?

We hear the howl again, then Leo's fist comes crashing through the window. Bobby tumbles away from the window in terror.

BOBBY
(stunned)
Leo?

From inside we hear Shelly scream, as Leo grabs her.

SHELLY (O.S.)
(screaming)
Bobby!

Bobby races to the door and tries to break it in, no luck.

9. INT. LEO'S - NIGHT

Leo has Shelly by the hair and is dragging her toward the living room. Off screen we can hear the frantic pounding and shouts of Bobby. They reach the kitchen and Leo drops her onto the floor. Stands over her for a long moment.

LEO
Good-bye wi-fe.

He raises up his big boot above her face, a tear falls from his eye, he's going to crush her. Shelly screams. Bobby bursts through the back door and is on Leo before he can react. They tumble to the floor, for a moment Bobby has an advantage.

BOBBY
You bastard!

Leo suddenly reaches up with tremendous strength, grabs a surprised Bobby by the neck and flips him on to the floor, then is on top of him. Leo smiles.

LEO
Hell-o Bob-by.

Leo begins to laugh, then tightens his grip. Bobby gags, the throat is beginning to go. Bobby manages to reach into a pocket and pull out his lighter, flicks it on. Leo stares at the flame, transfixed. Bobby moves the lighter close to Leo's face. Leo smiles, transfixed. Bobby then adjusts the flame and it shoots up into Leo's face, he erupts in a scream and covers his face with his hands.

LEO
(screaming)
Ahhhh!

He stands, bounces off the walls knocking things down, then runs out into the darkness. Bobby crawls over to Shelly, takes her in his arms, a tear falls from her eyes.

SHELLY
Bobby.

BOBBY
It's okay now, he's gone.

SHELLY
Don't leave me again, please, Bobby, please.

BOBBY
I'm here, baby, everything's all right now.

From out of the darkness we hear another one of Leo's howls. We move in on the open door, creaking on it's hinges.

A flashbulb whites out the scene. When it clears, we are on a white sheet being draped over the dead man laying on a stretcher. We pull back to Cooper looking tired from a long night of forensic work which is winding up.

TRUMAN
No prints, no fibers. You were right. If it's Earle, he
didn't miss a beat.
(hands Cooper a cup of coffee)
Did you hear from Denise, uh, Agent Bryson?

COOPER
(nods assent)
The DEA and the Bureau have cleared me of all criminal
charges. But the suspension stands. I'm waiting to hear
from Gordon

TRUMAN
In the meantime you're still my deputy. This case is
your's if you want it.

Cooper looks at the body as it's carried out.

COOPER
I want it, Harry.

Hawk enters.

HAWK
Found that stolen car on a logging road just as you said
... no prints. And just so you know, Hank Jennings
missed the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the
hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to
the bed and booked him for parole violation. One more
thing: Shelly Johnson just called. She says Leo Johnson
came to last night, attacked her and ran off into the
woods.

Harry and Cooper react. Another flashbulb goes off.

11. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - MORNING

Close on Andy trying desperately to pull off the surgical gloves he is wearing. He yanks, he pulls, one last try and it shoots off across the room, sticking to the sliding window of Lucy's office. Lucy looks up as Andy peels it off the glass.

ANDY
(whispering)
Lucy, we need to talk... It's about Nicky.

LUCY
Little Nicky?

ANDY
Dick and I have been doing some thinking and some
looking and we think he's a ... he's a ...

LUCY
A what?

The stretcher with the body is slowly wheeled out by TWO ATTENDANTS. One of the wheels squeaks incredibly loudly. Both Andy and Lucy's eyes are glued to the body as it slowly passes and exits.

ANDY
(looks around to make sure no one is listening)
We think he murdered his parents.

LUCY
He's nine years old.

ANDY
I know. We think he was six at the time of the crime -

LUCY
(slow boil)
I met little Nicky. I talked to little Nicky. If you two
think, for one second that I'll believe a little defenseless
orphan is a murderer ... the both of you aren't fit to be
fathers to a chimp!

Lucy reaches out, grabs one of the fingers on the glove Andy has on, stretches it out several feet and lets go... wap!

things about your work from Evelyn.

JAMES
See how you feel when you drive it.

JEFFREY
I'm sure it will be fine. Sounds like it's lucky we found
you.

James can't place this pleasant man with the one who beats his wife. He feels like hell.

JAMES
Lucky for me too.

JEFFREY
I hear you're on the road.

JAMES
Yeah. Will be again soon, I guess.

JEFFREY
No itinerary, no deadlines ... I'm envious. Wish I was
going with you.

Evelyn locks her eyes on James who can feel the heat. Jeffrey opens the door to the car.

JEFFREY
Maybe after I take her out for a spin we'll talk shop.
Sounds like we have a mutual love.
(slams the door)
Cars?

JAMES
Yeah, I don't know, I'm kind of overdue already...

EVELYN
Of course he'll stay. There are plenty of things I can
find for him to do... right James?

JAMES
Yeah, maybe.
(her look devours him)
Excuse me.

James leaves, heads for his room.

JEFFREY
Nice kid.

He looks at Evelyn.

EVELYN
He's done a fine job on the car.

Jeffrey slides into the car and ignites the engine. Races the motor.

15. INT. BEN'S OFFICE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

Close on the flames in the fireplace. We pull back. BEN HORNE, dressed as General Lee, puffs on a cigar as he sights a small cannon. On the floor of the office are toy soldiers in marching columns and an elaborate train set. DOCTOR JACOBY sits across the battle field, pencil and note pad in hand. The office doors swing open, Audrey enters with JERRY.

JERRY
Ben?

JACOBY
He prefers General.

AUDREY
He's marching on Washington. We think he's getting
close.

BEN
(elated)
Jeb!

Jerry looks at Audrey.

AUDREY
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.

JACOBY
(Soto)
You're with the cavalry.

BEN
Jeb, a great day is upon us. By dawn our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington. By mid-day it will fall,
and we will once again walk on my cherished fields in
Arlington.
(he looks at Jerry very solemnly)
Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief,
Jeb, that the almighty is a Southerner.

Ben moves back to his soldiers. Jerry looks at Audrey, then back at his brother, tries to smile.

JERRY
Hallelujah ...

Jerry glances over to Jacoby, motions him over to join Audrey and himself.

JERRY
You think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying a
sword?

JACOBY
Your brother is suffering from delusions brought about
by emotional collapse. He thinks he's on a forced march
to Washington. He's crossing the Maryland border as we
speak.

AUDREY
He's nuts.

JERRY
(pats her condescendingly on the head)
Why don't you let your uncle Jer decide that for himself.

Ben picks up the flag and waves it.

JERRY
(distraught)
Oh, Ben.

JACOBY
Actually what he is doing is quite healthy. By reversing the South's
defeat in the civil war he will in turn reverse his own setbacks. What he
needs now is both your understanding, a confederate victory, and a good
price for his cotton. Metaphorically speaking.

Jacoby smiles. Jerry looks over at Ben.

BEN
Men of the South, from this day to the ending of the earth we who fight
shall be remembered. For our bravery. For the battle scars we bear.
We few. We happy few. We band of brothers. Onwards... to
Washington.

16. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Close on the chess board set found with the body. We slowly circle it, coming to Cooper, intently staring at it. Coffee cup in hand. Harry joins him.

TRUMAN
How does chess figure into all this?

Cooper studies the board for a moment, then looks at Harry.

COOPER
Because we played a game every day for three years. Windom felt all
of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts created on the board.
And because I never beat him, and we both know it. Now I have to
make my next move. I'll publish it in the Twin Peaks Chronicle
tomorrow. That should do it. He's close.

TRUMAN
Coop, I think I need some more information here.

COOPER
Harry, I've brought some baggage to town with me I haven't told
you about.

TRUMAN
(not demanding)
Well, as your superior -

Cooper turns to Harry. The coffee cup shakes in his hand. Both notice. For the first time Truman sees fear in Cooper's eyes.

COOPER
Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law
and the bureau I owe to him. Four years ago we drew the assignment of
protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very gentle,
very beautiful woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I ... fell in love.

TRUMAN
What happened?

COOPER
One night, I failed in my vigilance. An attack was
made. I was wounded, stabbed, lost consciousness.
When I awoke, Caroline was in my arms. She was dead.
She had also been stabbed.

TRUMAN
(putting it together)
The wounds on the vagrant?

COOPER
Identical. The killer was never caught. My wounds
healed. Windom Earle ... went mad. Institutionalized,
until his recent escape.

TRUMAN
So why is he after you now?

COOPER
(a beat)
Harry, Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.

Harry takes a seat.

TRUMAN
So he blames you for her death.

COOPER
No. It's worse than that - much worse. I think he killed
her. And I think he also committed the murder that she
originally witnessed. He used to beat her, Harry, that's
what I found out when I ...
(can't continue for a moment)
Windom's mind is ... like a diamond. It's cold and
hard and brilliant and at some point he stopped caring
about right and wrong. I also believe Windom feigned
the insanity that sent him away. You don't know what
he's capable of. You don't know.

I'm sorry. Are you leaving?

JAMES
Yeah.

He walks over to his bags.

EVELYN
You were good with Jeffrey.

JAMES
It didn't feel like good.

EVELYN

She kisses him passionately, then begins to pull his shirt off. James pulls back.

JAMES
Look, I can't do this, it's wrong.

EVELYN
Love isn't wrong, James, it's just complicated ...

James walks over to the window, then turns and looks at her. The look melts her, and she realizes it.

DONNA
I'm looking for a biker. His name is James. James
Hurley. He's expecting me. He's expecting this.

She holds up an envelope. The Bartender looks her over, then glances at Evelyn and nods. Donna takes out a cigarette. She strikes a match, we follow it up to the cigarette.

EVELYN
You look like someone in need of help.

Donna studies her for a moment.

DONNA
Do I?

EVELYN
How old are you?

DONNA
Eighteen.

EVELYN

Maybe I can help.

DONNA
I can take care of myself

EVELYN
You on the road by yourself?

DONNA
I'm looking for someone.

Evelyn smiles, studies her for a moment.

EVELYN
What's his name?

DONNA
James.

EVELYN
James. James Hurley?

DONNA
Yes, do you know him? Know where he is?

EVELYN
He did some work for me recently.

DONNA
What kind of work?

EVELYN
He fixed my husband's car.

Donna tries to decide if this woman is a threat.

DONNA
Where is he?

EVELYN
He left, yesterday. On his bike.

DONNA
Where'd he go?

EVELYN
He said something about the ocean. Mexico. I'm not
sure.

DONNA

That's all?

Evelyn shakes her head. Seems to really feel for Donna.

EVELYN
Are you what he's running away from?

Donna doesn't say anything, holds onto her coffee. Evelyn finishes her drink.

EVELYN
Why don't you go home, dear ... a girl like you ... he'll

BIG ED
Thanks.

She leaves. Doc notices the look between them.

DOC
Where's Nadine, Ed?

BIG ED
She's got a wrestling match up at Knife River. Doc,
Nadine's what I wanted to talk to you about. You're a
father, girl in high school ...
(this is difficult)
Doc, Nadine wants to start dating other boys, and I,
well, I don't know what to say.

DOC
Is she sexually active?

BIG ED
Active? I wake up every morning feeling like I've been
run over by a lumber truck.

DOC
The extra adrenaline.

BIG ED
It's downright dangerous. She's liable to kill a young
kid. I don't know what to do.

DOC
Be patient. And tell her to be home by nine o'clock on
school nights.
(Ed smiles, Doc rises)
Ed, Donna took the van this morning, said something
about going to look for James. Is there anything I need
to be worried about?

BIG ED
He's out west a couple of hours, just trying to clear his head,
I think. Donna's taking him some money.

DOC
It's not easy being a parent is it?

BIG ED
It sure ain't.

Doc leaves, Norma walks over with a piece of pie. Slides in across from Ed.

NORMA
Hank's in the hospital. He says a tree fell on him.
(she reaches out and touches a bruise on his face)
Doesn't have anything to do with this, does it?

BIG ED
The tree was a redwood named Nadine.
(Norma doesn't quite get it)
Honey, after you left yesterday, Hank jumped me, right
in my own living room. The truth is, if Nadine hadn't
walked in when she did, it'd be me in the hospital or
someplace worse.

NORMA
Nadine took out Hank?

BIG ED
Yep. And it wasn't pretty.

Norma sits back, they study each other.

NORMA
Harry called, they're arresting Hank for a parole
violation. When he's well, he could be going back to
prison. I think it's time I start correcting a few of the
mistakes I've made.

He reaches out, takes her hand.

We could start by getting a cabin, a bottle of sparkling

Lucy leaves. Truman and Cooper turn their attention to Briggs.

TRUMAN
Major, what happened?

BRIGGS
As men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know
you are able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of
allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a
pledge.

COOPER
It can be very great.

BRIGGS
The Air Force, I thought was not unlike other societies
of men, dedicated to the fight for good.

Harry and Cooper look at each other wondering. Briggs gets up from his chair.

BRIGGS
Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried. When my superiors
questioned me about my disappearance they exhibited a
degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the
paranoic. I must now admit that their motivation in the
search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.
(turns to them)
I believe that during my disappearance I was taken to
the White Lodge. I remember virtually nothing, but I
have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble
ahead.

COOPER
What kind of trouble?

BRIGGS
I am not aware of the form it will take.
(straightens himself up, back to form)
I will return. Until that time, I will be in the shadows if
you need me. Good day, gentlemen.

On that note he leaves. Harry and Cooper are left a little dumbstruck.

Good, I wanted everyone to hear this. I have just spent
most of the last twenty four hours with this charming
young lady. And as you can see, I have no bruises, no
broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's
brother that she is cursed and somehow responsible for a
death is nonsense. What she does possess is a heightened
sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy, and touch, few men have ever had the pleasure
of experiencing, or the skill to match.

Lana blushes, smiles. Looks them all over. Pause.

TRUMAN
Is it warm in here?

EVERYONE
Yes.

Cooper steps forward, extends his hand.

LANA
Thank you. I could never have done it without Dr.

Right in here. Go ahead, Lana, it'll be fine.

Dwayne backs into the conference room with a reluctant Lana and closes the door.

Wait?

Cooper nods. Pause.

We've decided to adopt a child.

Lana kisses him again.

LANA
He's so much like Dougie, I feel like my husband's been
brought back to life.

DWAYNE
I've been lonely and selfish. I hope you'll all forgive
my boorish behavior. Come along, dear.

They get up and walk out, leaving everyone a little stunned.

TRUMAN
I could use a drink.

COOPER
This might be a good time for it.

29B. INT. BLUE PINE KITCHEN - NIGHT

PETE stares intently at a piece of paper on the kitchen counter, takes a long thoughtful drink of coffee, looks down at the paper again, then starts to take another drink , but stops and breaks into a smile, and points at the sheet of paper.

PETE
Hot dogs, we forgot hot dogs.

CATHERINE enters, studies the scene for a moment.

CATHERINE
Did Josie go shopping yet?

PETE
Yep, but we forgot the wienies. All beef, with the skin
on.

CATHERINE
If I can tear you away from this high-level executive
decision making for just a moment, I've got something
to show you.

Catherine walks over to the office doors, Pete follows several feet behind. They stand at the closed doors for a moment.

CATHERINE
Have you asked yourself, Pete, how I survived after the
fire? How I was able to effect my transformation into
Tojamura and marshall the resources I needed to defeat
Ben and win back the mill?

PETE
Now that you mention it ... yeah.

Catherine opens the doors, revealing ANDREW PACKARD. Pete is speechless.

ANDREW
(affectionately)
If it isn't sneaky Pete Martell.

PETE
(slow to read)
Andrew ... I saw the boat ... you ... you ...

ANDREW
(off his stuttering stupification)
Take all the time you need. Good old Pete.

CATHERINE
As you can surmise, I had Andrew's help.

PETE
So, let me get this straight, you didn't die in the boat
accident.

ANDREW
We didn't tell you, Pete, with apologies beforehand,
because you didn't need to know. And frankly ... we
didn't want you to.

PETE
Okay. Well, if you're bringing anybody else back from
the dead, I vote for Veronica Lake.

ANDREW
We discovered the attempt on my life was coming and
arranged for this little deception.

PETE
Lord, who tried to push the button on you, Andy?

CATHERINE
Does the name Thomas Eckhardt mean anything to you?

PETE
(a long deliberation)
No.

ANDREW
Eckhardt and I were business partners. I knew lumber, he
knew Hong Kong. We made a lot of money, had some
fun ... then I got the better of him in a piece of business
and he tried to stab me in the back ...

PETE
Really?

ANDREW
In a manner of speaking. He's a very dangerous and
powerful opponent.

CATHERINE
He plotted Andrew's death for six years. After he
thought Andrew was dead he came after me.

PETE
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?

Catherine and Andrew glance at each other. As if talking to a child.

CATHERINE
Pete, dear, Josie worked for Eckhardt.

PETE
That's right. She did? My God ... is she still?

CATHERINE
We'll find out when Eckhardt arrives.

PETE
He's coming here?

Andrew nods.

ANDREW
I've never known Josie's seductive powers to fail. He'll
come for her... Like a rat for cheese.

The fax machine begins to beep. Truman steps behind the desk to retrieve the incoming message. We see concern on his face. Andy and Cooper sit behind him.

Lucy walks in with Doc Hayward and DICK TREMAYNE. Everyone stops, sizes up the situation. A stern Doc zeros in on Andy.

HAYWARD
Andy, in here, we're going to talk.

Andy dutifully follows Doc into Truman's office. Truman studies the fax. Troubled.

TRUMAN
Coop, we've got another problem. I need to ask you a
favor.

That brings him back.

COOPER
Harry, there's something we have to get straight. You're
in charge, I work for you now. You say jump, I'll jump.

Cooper smiles, so does Harry.

TRUMAN
This just came over the wire from Seattle.

He shows him a clipping from a Seattle newspaper. MURDERED MAN FOUND IN ALLEY NEAR AIRPORT. And a picture of Jonathan, the Asian man. Murdered.

TRUMAN
She told me she got away from him.

COOPER
You think she is responsible for this?

Cooper studies the fax.

Close on Andy and Dick seated next to each other. Doc stands above them, his arms folded across his chest. Lucy vigorously paces the room.

HAYWARD
When Lucy told me about your "theory" I called the
orphanage and cut through the red tape. I immediately
got to the bottom of things because I was there when it
all begin. Little Nicky is no more a murderer than
Lucy or I.

TREMAYNE
I believe pathological was the phrase we used, Doc -

HAYWARD
Dick, I didn't drop you on your head when I brought you
into this world, don't give me cause to regret that.

ANDY
Doc, it's just -

HAYWARD
Shut up and listen, the both of you.

Lucy smacks a bug with a flyswatter like it's a baseball.

HAYWARD
Little Nicky entered this world through the back door
where hope and promise never saw the light. His mother
was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great
Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault by a
man in a back alley who fled across the border. She
never reported it to the police, but when she started to
show she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a
dream for a better life, for herself and her child. It was
the dream that brought her to this country. She decided
to carry that child. The poor wretch never saw the boy.
She died just as Nicky took his first breath. I delivered
that woman's baby. We buried her in Potter's Field and
sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years he was
shuttled from one state home to another. Then one day,
hope finally shined on little Nicky. A young childless
couple brought him into their lives. They were loving,
caring parents. It all collapsed in one terrible moment
on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six year old
Nicky managed to pull both his parents from the
burning wreck, but it was too late, and Nicky was alone
once again, as he is today.

LUCY
I hope you two are happy!

We move to Andy and Dick who are weeping uncontrollably.

Jones turns and looks across the lobby. Standing by the fireplace is Thomas Ekhardt, a mysterious, severe looking man, wearing sunglasses. The Clerk studies them for a moment, sensing something different about these two people.

EVELYN
Are you leaving? Are you leaving?

She walks over and runs her hands up his back to his shoulders. James spins around and grabs her by the wrists.

JAMES

I can't stay here anymore.

EVELYN
I don't understand -

JAMES
It's wrong.

She pulls away from him.

EVELYN
Because ... because I'm married.

JAMES
Yes. Yes.

She walks over to the window, looks out. A police car pulls up.

EVELYN
(softly)
I love you, James.

JAMES
Save it.

EVELYN
I've never said that to anyone in my life, but I'm saying
it to you now.

ANGLE OUT WINDOW, as two OFFICERS exit the car. BACK ON EVELYN, she turns from the window, there are tears in her eyes.

EVELYN
There's been an accident. Jeffery is dead.

A light bulb goes off in James's head as she walks toward him.

JAMES
His car?

EVELYN
Yes.

JAMES
You killed him.

She reaches him, tries to hold him.

EVELYN
No. No.

JAMES
My God. You set me up.

EVELYN
It was Malcolm's idea... He's not my brother.
(like a slap in the face, James gets it)
Hurry, the police are outside.

James rushes over to the window and looks out. Another car pulls up.

EVELYN
Go find that young girl who loves you.

James rushes over and picks up his bag, looks at her for a moment.

EVELYN
Go.

James goes to the back door, opens it and starts out.

Bar ... bar of soap ... bad girl...

Leo laughs, focuses on the figure in the doorway, the gun. He takes a step backward.

VOICE
No, no. Come in.

It's all right, I'm a friend. Come in.

Leo tentatively steps in.

MALCOLM
He's a drifter. I'm sure he was long gone once Mr. Marsh
pulled out of the driveway.

COP
Would you know his full name?

MALCOLM
I barely knew the kid. Jim... ah, Jim -

EVELYN
(from across the room)
James Hurley. He said he was from Twin Peaks.

COP
Work here long?

MALCOLM
Mrs. Marsh hired him to fix the Jaguar.

COP
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?

EVELYN
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down near Wally's. I went inside
to use the phone and he offered to help.

COP
We'll check there.
(moves to the door)
Thanks.

Malcolm shows them out. Closing the door he walks to Evelyn.

MALCOLM
And so we bid adieu to James Hurley.

EVELYN
Give it a rest.

Careful, Evelyn. I really couldn't tolerate a nervous co-

JAMES
But I didn't do anything. Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
I'm being framed

DONNA
It doesn't make any difference. We can't just wait for
cops to catch us. I think you should call Big Ed.

JAMES
No, my only chance is to talk to Evelyn. If she told me
this was a set up, maybe she'll tell the police, too.

DONNA
You wouldn't have a chance. The police will be waiting
for you. We've got to keep moving.

JAMES
But she'd listen to me. I know she would.

DONNA

Would she? Why?

His look tells her about his relationship with Evelyn.

DONNA
I'm gonna call Ed. Stay here.

Donna moves quickly to the phone. Dials. It takes awhile for ED to answer.

DONNA
Ed, it's Donna. I don't have much time. James is in lots
of trouble. He was working for this woman, repairing a
car and there was an accident - James thinks -

The COP from the Marsh House enters the bar. Donna stares at the cop and then at James who also watches the cop. James slides out of the bar. Donna is about to run after him when the Cop moves suspiciously towards her. She changes the subject.

DONNA

really cure, isn't he? He lettered in football? What

What were you doing at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?

BOBBY
I almost get killed and suddenly I'm on trial.

TRUMAN
We just want to know why Leo would attack you?

BOBBY
Here's the deal. Shelly and I are together, okay? We
have been for a long time, since before Laura died.
Before and after Leo went into his drool mode.

COOPER
(sees an opening)
Bobby, where were you the night the mill burned?

BOBBY
What's that got to do with this?

TRUMAN
Leo tried to kill you. Maybe you shot him that night.

BOBBY
No way. I went to Shelly's house the night of the fire
because I was worried about her. Leo was waiting for
me. He was about to play Paul Bunyan on me when Hank
Jennings shot him through the window.

TRUMAN
You sure it was Hank?

BOBBY
Absolutely.

COOPER
Is this true Shelly?

SHELLY
Yes.

COOPER
What about the insurance money?

BOBBY
Just a happy accident. I figure Leo owed us that.

TRUMAN
Where do you think Leo went?

BOBBY
You tell me.

Bobby has no intention of saying anything else.

TRUMAN
That will be all for now, Bobby. Shelly you be careful.

As Shelly and Bobby leave they bump into ALBERT ROSENFIELD in the doorway. Cooper is genuinely happy to see him.

COOPER
Albert.

ALBERT
Another trip on the Seattle to Twin Peaks Shuttle. I'll
confess to you gentlemen, coming down here today I
toyed with singing "Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the
Wall."
(opens his briefcase and drops a picture of Earle
on the table)
My invite back to Twin Peaks. Direct orders from
Gordon Cole. As he so succinctly put it,
(shouts like Cole)
"I'M WORRIED ABOUT COOP.
(spreads out a map, pointing out a pattern
marked on it)
Biloxi, Houston, Oklahoma City, Salina, Lincoln,
Chicago. Earle's been sending gift wrapped packages to
police departments and offices of major law
enforcement agencies. Each look like mail bombs, but
turn out to be harmless. Deliveries are paid for with
phony credit cards signed "Windom Earle." Cole's
doing the follow up on this. He should run up here after
that.

ALBERT
One article of clothing in each.
(shows photos)
A white net veil, a garter, a pair of white slippers, a
string of pearls, and, finally, a wedding dress.

COOPER
Caroline ...

ALBERT
He's got the DEA, FBI, Treasury, Postal Service and
the Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Illinois state patrols
looking for him. Invited all of them to the party, but
my guess is he won't dance with anyone but you, Coop.

Cooper is unnerved. Albert retrieves more work from his case.

ALBERT
The vagrant in the office died from a knife wound
severing the aorta. He'd been dead for two days.

TRUMAN
But it's finger was pointing to the chess board? How did
he manage that with the rigamortis?

ALBERT
Rigamortis goes from head to toe but after two days
leaves the body toe to head. Earle waited for it to leave
the arms and fingers so that he could maneuver them on
the chess board.
(moving on)
And then he played Zeus at the power station.

COOPER
How do you know?

ALBERT
He left us this map. Taped under a table.

Cooper moves away from the map. Stares our the window. Albert worries for his friend.

ALBERT
(picks up a piece off the chess game)
He's making his move. Most definitely.

Albert moves to the door. Tries to cheer Cooper up.

ALBERT (CONTINUED)
About the uniform, Coop. Replacing the elegance of the
dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of a mouse
brown work outfit is a form of fashion suicide, but, call
me crazy, I like it.

Albert goes out. Truman studies the frightened Cooper.

6. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

LEO JOHNSON in bed with his wounds from the night before freshly dressed. WINDOM EARLE sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. Five stainless steel square suitcases rest near him. The chess board is set up on the table. A small school desk sits by the door. On one wall is a Earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring devices, police scanners. Leo awakes to the haunting flute music.

EARLE
Ah, you are awake, then.
(stands over him)
I trust you've slept well.
(goes to his computer returns with Leo's picture
and a police APB)
While you slept I've learned all about you.
(holds up Leo's picture)
"Leo Johnson."
(takes out Leo's sheet)
The police would like to see you as soon as possible.
"Drug trafficking, arson, attempted murder."
(studies the next item)
"Domestic violence." I'm partial to that.

Leo tries to make a bolt for the door. Earle slams his wound with his flute. Leo falls back.

EARLE
Well, Leo, I have cleansed your wounds. You're on the
mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
(tasting this)
Leo. Leo the Lion.
(plays a trill on the flute)
I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do
that?

Leo hesitates. Earle shows the flute to Leo.

EARLE
In thirteenth century Japan the Samurai were stripped of
their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and
treated bamboo of their Shaku hachi flute made an
excellent cudgel.
(smacks Leo again, then walks back to the table)
This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
think?

Leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows Earle to have more fun with his flute. It ends with Earle standing over Leo near the doorway. He takes a dog collar out of his coat.

EARLE
I wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
you've ruined it.

He wraps the collar around Leo's neck. Attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.

EARLE
Now, come over here. I've made you some gruel.

As Earle returns to the table, Leo scrambles for the door. He stops short. Struggling with an electrical shock coming from the collar. He falls backwards. Stunned. Earle sits at his table.

EARLE
Come here, Leo. Come on.

Leo struggles towards the table as Earle plays his flute.

ED
Almost twenty years, Norma. One day we're talking
about a graduation party and the next day we're here. In
between nothing but hurt.

NORMA
I tried not to think about it. Spent more and more time
in the diner trying to make the place work because there
was nothing else. We were open everyday so that I
wouldn't have another life. No birthdays, no Fourth of
July, no Christmas.

ED
I turned all my Christmases into a week full of
Mondays. When that didn't work I'd spend my time
thinking about presents I never got to buy you. Never got
to give you.

NORMA
I bought you a present last Christmas. An onyx and
turquoise bolo tie. I walked over to your house to give it
to you, but I just stood there and waited to see you
through a window. I should have just walked right in. I
don't know why I didn't. I'm sorry I didn't.

ED
All the time that you should have been in my home. My
bed.

NORMA
It's about the future now, Ed, and what we are going to
do about it.
(kisses him)
I want you to pick me up after I close the diner, tonight,
and I want you to take me home.

ED
You're right, it's all ahead of us.

Ed rolls on top of Norma with a kiss. As Norma responds they are interrupted by a crash from the next room.

Norma scrambles to get her clothes on, but Ed stops her.

ED
Don't Norma. I may as well talk to her now.

Before they can get up, NADINE HURLEY walks into the room. She sits dejectedly on the bed. She carries a trophy.

ED
Hello, Nadine.

NADINE
Got all the way to the District Finals at Knife River
only to find out the airplane slam is illegal. I was
disqualified.
(holds up the trophy)
Second Place. What a drag.

ED

That's a tough break, alright.

Nadine stares at Norma for a moment.

NORMA
Hello, Nadine.

NADINE
I owe you an apology, Norma. I mean I really pounded
Hank and I am sorry. But I thought he was going to do
something to Eddie and I sort of got mad.

NORMA
Thank you.

Nadine gets up and walks to the door. Turns back.

NADINE
Know what?
(sad but honest)
I know about you guys. And it's really, really okay.
Cause now, I don't feel so guilty about me and Mike.

ED
You and Mike.

NADINE
I don't want to get into it, but I have to tell you, it is
really, really serious.

So you two should do whatever you want. I am
completely cool about all of this. Really.

Nadine slowly exits leaving a baffled Norma and Ed.

Something in the laundry catches Cooper's eye.

COOPER

BEN HORNE talks to a stunned group of HOTEL STAFF. He sits on a saddle draped over a STUFFED HORSE. Young JOHNNY HORNE stands nearby, arms folded, Indian headdress on, mind blank and jumbled. DR. JACOBY stands to one side. Observing.

BEN
So I said to Stonewall Jackson. "What would you like
to do when we run the Yanks up to Canada?" And he says,
"Follow them. I'd like to be the Duke of Montreal."
And I say to Stonewall, "Then we'd have to fight the
French?" And then he just gives me that Stonewall look
of his and says, 'What are we waiting for?"

Ben laughs heartily. Johnny gives a hearty howl. The Hotel staff reacts with ashen silence. Jacoby walks to the back of the room to confer with a bemused JERRY HORNE and a concerned AUDREY.

AUDREY
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?

JACOBY
Letting him out to mingle with the public does not seem
to have helped.

AUDREY
We can't just leave him like this.

JERRY
Well, you have to admit he's kind'a fun this way.

AUDREY
(turning to Jacoby)
Dr. Jacoby I want you to bring my father back.

JACOBY

All pause to consider this desperate measure. Just then. BOBBY BRIGGS rushes past Ben and the staff and up to Aubrey. He is dressed as a CONFEDERATE BUGLE BOY.

BOBBY
Sorry, I'm late boss.

HOLD ON this incongrous tableau, as Ben chatters on in the background...

BEN
I asked Stonewall what I should do with Lincoln and he
said, "Honest Abe is going to be about as useful to you

(looks at Donna, pats the stool next to her)
It's alright, dear, sit down.

DONNA
(diving in)
Why are you doing this to James?

EVELYN
Why not?

DONNA
Don't you realize how good he is?

EVELYN
He was good at two things. The car and me. He's a lot
of fun. But then, I hope you already know that.

DONNA
(almost shouting)
You don't get it do you? I'm talking about our lives.

EVELYN
Life will be rosy if you can just get out of one silly little
jam. Maybe. Maybe not.
(takes another drink)
Talk to me in a couple of years when you're whole life
has turned to crap. Cause that's what happens, you know.
Life turns to crap.

DONNA
Because you've made a mess of your life we have to pay.

EVELYN
Are you looking for that pure heart that beats within the
evil vixen? Dial on. He's going over.

DONNA
You make everything sound so pointless and stupid.

EVELYN
(takes another drink)
If there was a reason to climb out of the primeval swill,
believe me, dear, I'd know it.

DONNA
Would you? Really?

Before they can go any further Malcolm appears behind them. Moves to Evelyn quickly, but quietly.

MALCOLM
Here you are.

Takes her strongly by the hand.

MALCOLM
Get in the car.

Evelyn obediently weaves towards the door. Malcolm turns to Donna. Takes her firmly by her shoulders and whispers.

MALCOLM
There is nothing you can do for your friend, honey. So
trundle back to your little town safe in the knowledge
that if you come here again, I will kill you.

Malcolm goes to the door.

DONNA
(shouting)
Don't do this to him. Please.

Donna watches them go out.

16. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Cooper enters the conference room. Agent Rosenfield sits at an overhead projector.

ALBERT
(re first slide)
The vicuna thread sample taken from Josie's coat.
(re second slide)
The traces found on the floor outside your room.

Cooper turns out the lights. Albert is illuminated by the projector's glow. He places two slides upon the overhead plate. Images cast upon the blackboard wall.

COOPER
(he already knows the answer)
Did they come from the same coat?

INCLUDE INSERT

A microscopic comparision of the two slides.

ALBERT
Let me put it to you this way, Coop. Either Josie
Packard pulled the trigger, or she's loaning her winter
wear to the wrong kind of people.
(looking up at Cooper)
A perfect match.

Cooper sits opposite with a sigh. Considers Josie. And Sheriff Truman.

COOPER
What about the gloves?

ALBERT
Still checking for powder burns. I'll have the results by
morning.

COOPER
Did you look into the Seattle homicide?

Albert produces crime photos from a folder on the tabletop, slides them to Cooper.

ALBERT
Locals are looking for a "beautiful Asian Woman", late
twenties in connection with the murder of one Jonathan
Kumaguy. Mr. Kumaguy has an Interpol sheet as long as
your arm...and three holes in the back of his head. I'm
betting the bullets will match the slugs we took out of
your vest.

COOPER
(looking at photos)
Josie. Again.

ALBERT
Coop, as you know, Truman and I have had our
differences in the past. But the big lug's got his heart in
the heart in the right place if nothing else. And I'm not above
feeling a little sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.

COOPER
What's your point?

ALBERT
Speaking frankly...our Sheriff's got a serious problem
with his girlfriend.

COOPER
(rising to exit)
Albert. Not one word until we're certain.
CUT TO:


17. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Cooper enters. Sheriff Truman sits at his desk, a fax before him. A chess board has been set up nearby. Cooper pauses, Albert's information weighs heavily on him.

TRUMAN
(referring to fax)
Our John Doe has a name. Erik Powell. Transient.
Former Merchant Marine by his prints. Other than that...

COOPER
(chilled)
Powell?

TRUMAN
Yeah. Ring a bell?

COOPER
Caroline. Windom Earle's wife. Powell was her
maiden name.

TRUMAN
Do you think this Powell is a relative?

COOPER
(stepping to chess board, shaken)
No. Earle's playing a game of chess according to his
own rules. Every move sends a message. The name
Powell tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing that happened
between us. The marine is the first pawn removed from
the board. Murder committed for my benefit.

TRUMAN
(figuring, re board)
So whenever he takes a piece here ...

COOPER
(nodding toward window/outside)
Someone dies out there ...
(turning to gaze at chess board)
I never beat him.

TRUMAN
(after a beat)
Coop, if it's a chess expert you need ... we've got one of
the best right here in in Twin Peaks.

COOPER
I could use the help, Harry. But Earle is a genius.

TRUMAN
(confident)
I'll arrange a demonstration.
DISSOLVE TO:


18. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

START CLOSE on three small chess boards set up on the counter. A pair of hands move swiftly from one to the next. We HEAR.

PETE'S VOICE
Check ... Mate ... Check...

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals PETE MARTELL wrapping up a trio of speed chess games in brilliant fashion. He stands across the counter from his three opponents - Cooper, DOC HAYWARD, and a bespectacled TOAD - moving effortlessly from board to board, a picture of focus and concentration. Truman looks on with evident satisfaction.

Toad mutters, shakes his head. He's the first to lose. Doc Hayward makes a rather timid move. Pete pounces with a friendly grin.

PETE
Mate ...
(pauses, waits for Cooper)
And mate.

COOPER
Pete, frankly, I'm impressed.

PETE
I owe it all to the immortal Master: Jose Raoul
Capablanca. If there's chessboards in heaven, you'll find
Jose sittin' across from the Lord.
(Pete points at Hayward's board, exclaims)
The Caro-Karin defense. A Classic.

TRUMAN
They don't come any better. Doc?

HAYWARD
(still staring at the board)
The mind reels.
(smiling at Pete)
One of these days...

COOPER
(leaning forward)
Pete, I need your help. I'm playing a chess match of
considerable importance. I can't tell you any more than
that. I want to put the game into a stalemate while
losing the least number of pieces possible. None, if you
can arrange it.

PETE
(after a beat)
Agent Cooper, I'd be honored to serve. Chess being my
bailiwick.

COOPER
Thanks, Pete. Great players are either far or few.

Pete puffs up with pride. He nearly salutes.


19. NORMA JENNINGS

Norma cleans the counter, glances at the chess games, SEES, Shelly Johnson step into view.

SHELLY
Hi.

NORMA
(immediate concern)
Shelly. I heard about Leo. Are you okay?

SHELLY
(not so sure)
Sure. Bobby's looking after me, so I guess I'm safe and
everything...

NORMA
I wanted to come right over. But with Hank gone, it's a
madhouse around here.

SHELLY
Well ... do you need any help? I've got plenty of time
now... I'd feel better during the day, you know, if I was
here...

Shelly's asking for her old job back. And Norma knows it.

NORMA
Are you kidding? Things aren't the same without you.
When can you start?

SHELLY
I don't know, I guess I could start ... now.

NORMA
Welcome back, sweetheart.

They hug. A nice beat. Truman interrupts:

TRUMAN
Excuse me, Norma? Can I talk to you for a minute?

NORMA
(she knows what this is about)
Sure.
(to Shelly)
Your apron's in the back.

Shelly beams, steps off Truman and Norma speak privately:

TRUMAN
Hank's nearly well enough to leave the hospital. I
figured you should know.

NORMA
What about his parole violations? Harry, this time I
don't want him back.

TRUMAN
I wouldn't worry. Hank's next stop is a jail cell. We're
charging him with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
Add that to breaking parole...it looks like Hank's going
away for a long, long time.

NORMA
(after a beat)
Good.

Pete is HEARD shouting checkmate off-screen. Another speedy triumph.

21. INT. THE BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

JOSIE PACKARD, in servant's uniform, places the last piece of silver upon a large dinner table set for two situated at the center of the Blue Pine living room. CATHERINE MARTELL, dressed to entertain, supervises Josie's lowly chores with relish.

CATHERINE
Josie, please. Give the fork a little room.
(Josie sighs, rearranges)
Put it right there. Perfect. Now you may prepare to
serve.

JOSIE
(eyes on the empty chairs)
Who will be joining you this evening?

CATHERINE
That is secret.

Just then: the DOORBELL rings. Josie reacts with a start.

CATHERINE
The door ... ?

Josie nods, steps to answer it. She opens the door, goes white with fear. THOMAS ECKHARDT stands before her. He stares at Josie with dark soulless eyes. Catherine chirps from the rear.

CATHERINE
Ahh, Mister Eckhardt. Welcome.

Josie reacts with a trembling panic, uncertain whether to stay or flee. Eckhardt finally turns his gaze from her, smiles at Catherine as she approaches.

ECKHARDT
Thank you.

CATHERINE
Josie, where are your manners? Help our guest with his
coat.

Eckhardt turns back to Josie. Catherine smiles. HOLD ON Josie as she reaches for Eckhardt's coat. Trapped by their civility.

DISSOLVE TO:

22. INT. BLUE PINE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

START CLOSE on a pair of trembling hands opening a bottle of wine, then setting it upon a serving tray. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Josie in the kitchen, carrying the tray toward the living room. Josie steps toward Catherine and Eckhardt seated at the large circular dinner table. They converse, run forks through salads on fine china.

ECKHARDT
(to Catherine, sardonic throughout)
I must confess I received your invitation with some
surprise.

CATHERINE
Word travels fast in Twin Peaks. It seemed fitting that
I dine with my late brother's business rival. Some wine,
Josie.

Eckhardt listens to Catherine's charter, now looks up at Josie as she steps toward them

ECKHARDT
(an easy charm)
Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends.
Andrew was a witty, intelligent, and charming man.
Plaudits no doubt employed to describe his sister as well.

CATHERINE
(ignoring the compliment)
But your friendship soured.

ECKHARDT
Sadly. Men of business frequently find their personal
lives disrupted by the larger portraits they paint.

CATHERINE
(matching his sardonic tone)
You consider yourself an artist?

ECKHARDT
(with humor)
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.

CATHERINE
(cool and careful)
I wonder, Mister Eckhardt. When you had him killed,
was it for art or money? Don't stand there, Josie, pour.

Josie nearly drops her bottle of wine. But Eckhardt betrays no reaction. He simply turns his gaze from Josie to Catherine. Catherine's playing a dangerous game. Eckhardt will play along ... for now. Josie pours blood-red wine into crystal glasses with a shaking hand.

ECKHARDT
(a gentle tone)
Call me Thomas. Your brother did.

CATHERINE
Thomas. We'll have the h'or d'ouerves now, Josie.

Josie moves off to fetch them. As the conversation continues:

ECKHARDT
One does not kill for art or money. They are
commodities easily lost, but just as easily gained.
However, one -
(small smile, moving from general to particular)
- rather, I, would find reason to kill for love.

CATHERINE
Did you love her that much?

Josie returns, offering a tray of canapes. Eckhardt's tone has been cratonic throughout. But now he pauses. looks at Josie. Takes a small confection from the tray. And speaks quietly:

ECKHARDT
Yes.

Eckhardt pops the canape in his mouth. Josie nearly drops the tray. Catherine speaks evenly, as if describing a prized possession.

CATHERINE
(finally giving this love a name)
Josie has the most incredible hands. They effect a sort
of porcelain grace. Each finger a thing of beauty.

ECKHARDT
I remember.

Eckhardt reaches out to touch Josie's hand. Josie stands up with a start, freezes. Eckhardt never takes his eyes from her.

CATHERINE
I wonder. What shall we do with her now?
(eyes to Josie, effecting neutrality)
You've come so far to Twin Peaks. It would be a shame
to leave us empty-handed.

ECKHARDT
It would.

CATHERINE
On the other hand, Josie is almost completely
untrustworthy. She'll betray you again. And again.

ECKHARDT
I have managed to find pleasure in even that repetition.

CATHERINE
Of course I'll miss her cheery disposition. We've
become the very best of friends. Two girls chatting over
tea ...

ECKHARDT
Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind. A
cat or a dog.

CATHERINE
But if I give her to you. What will you give me in
return?

ECKHARDT
How can one put a value to something so precious.

CATHERINE
But you will ... try?

ECKHARDT
(after a beat)
Yes.

CATHERINE
(sharply)
Josie?

Josie stands mute, trapped in this waking nightmare. She can barely manage a whisper:

JOSIE
Yes?

CATHERINE
Thomas and I will have our main course now.

HOLD ON Josie for a beat.

24. INT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT

Evelyn Marsh steps through the dark living room. She carries drink and cigarette, sits upon a large sofa. Evelyn drinks deeply. Blows smoke-rings toward the shadows that ripple across the ceiling. Just then: a VOICE in the dark.

JAMES' VOICE
Why did you do it?

Evelyn reacts, startled. James steps out of the black.

JAMES
I've been givin' it a lot of thought. And I still don't
understand.

James pauses, pent up, full of anger. Evelyn stands to meet him.

EVELYN
James, you're not safe here. If Malcom finds you...

JAMES
(intense)
For money, is that it? No, wait. I got it: Malcom's a
wrong guy and he made you play along, right? I can
believe that. Make me believe it, Evelyn. Tell me a
story. 'Cause I'm all mixed up and I just want to know
why you did this to me.

EVELYN
(reaching for him)
James...

JAMES
(cold with fury)
Don't touch me.

Evelyn pauses. A long beat, then she whispers:

EVELYN
What did you expect? Apology? A hidden heart of
gold?
(simply)
I did it all. Everything. I found you I lured you in.
And I kept you here while Malcom planned a nice, neat
frame.

JAMES
Why?

EVELYN
For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to.

Her words chill him. James' anger subsides. He expected excuses, regret. Anything but this.

EVELYN
That's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, James?
The truth hurts. I know.

James stares into her eyes. Evelyn moves closer. The truth hurts her too:

EVELYN
You're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't
mean there weren't moments when I truly wanted you
here. Not for the money or for Malcom. But for me.
For the good and honest way you taste.

A long beat. And despite everything she's told him, or perhaps, in some odd way, because of it...James steps toward Evelyn's arms.

JAMES
I wanted you too.

They exchange a gentle kiss. A beat. Footsteps behind them, a sudden leap ... AND MALCOLM APPEARS, STRIKES JAMES ON THE HEAD. James slips to the floor, lies still. Evelyn looks at his inert form with shock, then to Malcolm.

Malcolm speaks quietly, words for Evelyn to commit to memory. Her story, her alibi, a tale to be told to the police.

MALCOLM
(dead calm)
James broke into the house. He was angry, he was crazy.
He killed Jeffrey and now he came back to kill you. A
poor, helpless widow. But you were ready for him,
Evelyn. You got your gun ... and you shot James until he
was dead.

HOLD ON Evelyn for a beat. Malcolm before her. James helpless on the floor.

CUT TO:


26. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT

A fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. Windom Earle peers into a mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. He speaks aloud as he prepares his disguise:

EARLE
Work slowly and with care. Everything must be written
in a steady, uncompromising hand.

Leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him. He painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. The shock-collar still hangs about his neck. Earle steps behind him, peers over Leo's shoulder. He uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.

EARLE
No, no, no. Terrible.
(pointing to offending section)
Erase.

Earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. A low-grade SHOCK shivers through Leo's body. Leo reacts with a shudder. Then erases in haste, looks up at Earle with plaintive expression.

EARLE
Now. Try again. Concentrate.

Leo looks back to the paper. As if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him. He puts pen to paper. But he errs again.

EARLE
(with manic disgust)
Oh, Leo. For heaven's sake.

Another stinging shock. Leo turns, as if to flee. But Earle is upon him. He grabs Leo's hand in an iron grip.

EARLE
Let me show you.

Earle guides Leo's hand to the paper. And carefully leads him through the difficult section. There is something odd and tender about Earle's actions. As teacher to pupil. Father to son.

EARLE
See? Like this. There you go. Much better. Now you
finish.

A beat. Leo proceeds, afraid, but more determined somehow. Earle watches with satisfaction as Leo completes the unseen document. He gives Leo a friendly pat on the head.

EARLE
I am proud of you, Leo.

Leo looks up it Earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.

LEO
Windom ... Earle...

EARLE
(pleased)
Yes. Windom.

Earle picks up Leo's work. THREE child-like VALENTINES. In the center of each heart is a picture: Shelly, Donna, and Aubrey. They are surveillance photos. Leo has written their names on each valentine.

EARLE
Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one will be my
Queen?

LEO
(fairly mindless repetition)
Queen ...

Earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . Leo reacts with a protesting groan.

LEO
No...

Earle looks at him sharply. Leo cowers at his school-desk. Earle produces three identical envelopes, one for each torn third.


27. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

START CLOSE ON Aubrey dressed as Scarlett O'Hara, in hoop skirt and bonnet. A surreal tableau follows. Grant's surrender as enacted by Ben Horne (as the victorious General Lee), Dr. Jacoby (as the vanquished General Grant), Jerry Horne (as Wilmer McLean), Aubrey (as daughter McLean) and Bobby (as the miserable Bugle Boy).

Ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him. Aubrey steps forward with a smile.

AUDREY
(playing it up, and playing it well)
Welcome to our humble home, General Lee.

BEN
Thank you. You are ...?

AUDREY
Scarlett McLean. This is my father.

Aubrey gestures toward Jerry in his farmer's suit. But Jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with stage fright. So Aubrey repeats:

AUDREY
(a little louder)
This is my father.

Jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching Ben's sword.

JERRY
(the world's worst southern accent)
Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to
make your extremely suitable acquaintance.
(offers the stagiest of bows)

BEN
Why are you armed with my sword?

JERRY
(stumped, remaining in bowed posture)
I ... like your sword. Sire.

Ben frowns, surrounded by idiots no matter which universe he inhabits. Aubrey ushers Jerry to the side.

AUDREY
Thank you, Daddy.

BEN
(checking his watch, anachronism be damned)
Where is General Grant?

JERRY
(doing his best/worst to contribute)
General Grant's a-comin', sire. I know'd it.

An awkward beat. Jacoby remains in hiding. Someone's missed their cue. Jerry looks at Aubrey. Aubrey frowns, shoots a look at Bobby. Bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. The cue Jacoby's been waiting for. A beat. And he steps forward, with as much diginity as stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. Ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores it. And extends a hand.

BEN
General Grant.

JACOBY
General Lee.

AUDREY
(taking charge)
Please, gentlemen. Sit down.

She gestures toward the small round table. They sit.

BEN
We once met during the Mexican War. Do you
remember?

JACOBY
(calling upon high school drama training,
sticking to the script)
I have come to surrender the North.

Ben reacts. Is he the only sane man in the room?

BEN
(trying to carry on an actual conversation)
The Mexican War. Do you remember?

JACOBY
(backing and filling)
It was a good war as I remember.

BEN
Nonsense. All wars are nothing more than madness
disguised as the patriotic ventures of politicians too old
or cowardly to participate in them. I have no love of
war. And even less for politicians.

JACOBY
(a little dazed by the outburst)
Me neither.

BEN
(wondering if this can possibly be Grant)
But as for the men who fight them...
(living the moment)
Well. They have my eternal respect and sympathy.
(with a sigh)
Very well, General. Enough fruitless conversation. My
terms. Federal officers may keep their side arms and
general possessions. Officers and men claiming to own
horses may keep them too. And each officer and man
will be allowed to return to his home, not to be
disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities.

JACOBY
(eager to complete the process)
I surrender.

Ben pauses. Rewriting history wasn't supposed to be like this. He sighs.

BEN
Of course you do. The articles ... ?

Ben looks about, no paper on the desk. Jerry hurries forward, having missed his cue.

JERRY
The articles, sire.

BEN
(finally correcting)
Sir.

JERRY
(retreats bowing and scraping)
Sir.

BEN
(offering him a pen)
General Grant. You will sign?

JACOBY
Yes.
(finally rising to the occasion)
And may I add that you have been a valiant opponent of
both noble bearing and fine character. Qualities happily
reflected in the hearts and minds of your brave men.

BEN
(genuinely flattered)
Thank you.

Jacoby signs. He hands the pen to Ben. Ben signs as well. Jerry reveals a harmonica, begins to PLAY the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the background.

BOBBY AND AUDREY look on from the perimeter. Bobby turns to Aubrey.

BOBBY
(sotto voce)
I thought the North won the Civil War...

Aubrey rolls her eyes. Ben and Jacoby stand, shake hands a second time. Jerry steps closer, playing loudly now. Ben gets fully into the spirit of the moment, tears gather in his eyes, he's at the pinnacle again, he's triumphed over inestimable odds ... and FAINTS dead away.

AUDREY
Daddy!

Jerry, Jacoby, and Aubrey gather about the fallen General. Jacoby loosens his collar. Bobby stands just behind them.

JACOBY
Give him room.

JERRY
Ben!

AUDREY
Daddy, can you hear me? Daddy?

A beat. Then, a long last, Ben's eyes flutter ... and open. He speaks:

BEN
Where am I?

JERRY
Twin Peaks.

BEN
(gazing up at them)
I had the strangest dream. You were there, and you, and you...
(he spots Bobby behind them)
Who are you?

BOBBY
Bobby Briggs. Sir.

BEN
Oh.
(back to the dream)
It was incredible. There was a war. And I was a
General. General Lee. And somehow, despite
incredible odds against me, I won. It ... well. I know
it's impossible. But you were all there. And I was too.

AUDREY
Bur you're back now, Daddy. You're home.

BEN
Yes. I am.

JERRY
Atta boy, Ben.

JACOBY
How do you feel? Any aftereffects. Dizziness?

BEN
To tell you the truth...
(beat, as if to check)
I feel terrific. I feel like...

JERRY
Yes ...?

AUDREY
What is it, Daddy?

BEN
(noticing)
What in the world are you doing in those clothes?

Jerry does a little impromptu dance of celebration. Aubrey hugs her father. Dr. Jacoby sits back on his heels, still wearing his tattered uniform. Bobby plays a rolling figure on his trumpet.

28. EXT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS toward the house, a moving POV, now peering through a window inside. Evelyn kneels by James on the floor. Malcom enters the living room carrying a pistol in his right hand. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Donna looking through the window, reacting to the horrifying scene within.
CUT TO:


29. INT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT

Malcom holds the gun toward Evelyn, grip-end first.

MALCOM
The story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on the
gun.

EVELYN
(rising to her feet)
No. I can't...

MALCOM
Just your prints. Leave the rest to me.

Malcom forces the gun into Evelyn's hand. Then produces a glove, slips it on his right hand.

MALCOM
I'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric. Five
shots, tightly grouped. Like the gun went off in your
hand. Repeatedly.

Glove on, Malcom holds out his hand for the gun. But Evelyn hesitates, steps back from him.

MALCOM
Evelyn...?

Just then: Donna races into the living room.

DONNA
NO!!

Malcom whirls about. Donna races to James, kneels to hold him in her arms. To protect him from further harm. James stirs, barely conscious.

JAMES
(faintly)
Donna...?

DONNA
(looking up at Malcom and Evelyn)
Don't hurt him. Please. Don't hurt him anymore.

MALCOM
(eyes on Donna and James, holds out hand)
The gun, Evelyn.

DONNA
(pleading for their lives)
I called the police. They're coming. You'll never get
away with this...

EVELYN
Malcom...

MALCOM
She's lying. Give me the gun.

DONNA
(directing her whispered plea toward Evelyn)
Don't do it. Please don't let us die.

MALCOM
(holding out gloved hand for the gun)
Evelyn.

EVELYN
(after a beat, softly)
No.

Malcom whirls about. Finds Evelyn gawking fondly at the young lovers. The gun held tightly in her hand.

EVELYN
I can't do it. I won't.

There is a transcendant determination in her voice. A soul reclaimed. Malcom darkens.

MALCOM
I will.

He steps forward, means to wrest the gun from Evelyn's hands. But Evelyn FIRES, a bullet slams into Malcom's chest. He staggers, looks down at the wound with surprise. He steps toward Evelyn, the gun smoking in her outstretched hand. But his legs fail him. Malcom staggers, Malcom falls dead to the floor. A beat. Donna weeps, cradles James in her arms. Evelyn drops the gun. And in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story Malcom taught her.

EVELYN
He was angry, he was crazy. He killed Jeffrey and he
came back to kill me. But I was ready for him. I got
my gun. And I shot him. I shot him until he was dead...

A distant siren wails.

A man pauses in the hotel lobby. It is Windom Earle in disguise. Earle looks about, reacts. He SEES Agent Cooper step into view. Earle walks quickly to a pillar nearby, hides behind it.

Meanwhile, Cooper steps through the lobby after a long day. He walks past Earle in hiding, continues. Then reacts, as if he'd felt someone's eyes upon him. Cooper turns, takes a closer look... but there is no one to be seen. Earle has moved on. Cooper shrugs, steps inside the waiting elevator.

A beat. Earle steps to reception, pleased with his subterfuge. He watches the elevator door close, turns to hand an envelope to the night clerk.

EARLE
For Miss Audrey Horne.

32. INT. GREAT NORTHERN ROOM - NIGHT

Cooper enters his room, removes jacket and gun. Then he pauses, notices something ahead. A strange shape beneath his bedspread where the pillow lies. Cooper steps closer, carefully pulls it back.

A plaster deathmask has been set upon his pillow. The face of a beautiful woman. Caroline.

Cooper stares at the mask for a long, long beat. His heart floods with sad memory. Then, careful not to break it, Cooper lifts the mask off his bed. Beneath it ... a small tape recorder, now activated by the mask's removal. Cooper reacts, waits. And hears the familiar VOICE of Windom Earle.

EARLE'S VOICE
Breathtaking, wasn't she? A truly beautiful woman,
Caroline. Funny, after all this time, after all that
happened in Pittsburgh ... I still love her. And I know
that you do too ...

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
A hotel. A nightstand. A drawer pull on the drawer. A drawer pull of a nightstand in the room of a hotel. What could possibly be happening on or in this drawer pull? How many drawer pulls exist in this world? Thousands, maybe millions? What is a drawer pull? This drawer pull - why is it featured so prominently in a life or in a death of one woman who was caught in a web of power?


CLOSE ON: LOG LADY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the face of the LOG LADY.

LOG LADY
Can a victim of power end in any way connected to a drawer pull? How can this be?

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of an ornamental owl in a small glass case sitting on the corner edge of TRUMAN'S desk. WINDOM EARLE'S voice emanates from a recording.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Now Dale, listen carefully its your move. Please, put your heart into it will you.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on a chessboard sitting atop TRUMAN'S desk.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
I’ve noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking as if your mind were occupied with issues other then those on the board before you.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on a white mask, the mask taken from COOPER'S hotel room.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Such preoccupation not only weakens one’s resolve but one’s foresight as well.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on the mini tape recorder WINDOM EARLE left along with the white mask in COOPER'S hotel room.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
A deadly failing in any match you must agree but in this particular contest quite disastrous ...

We ZOOM OUT. SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN sits behind his desk drinking a cup of coffee as he listens to WINDOM'S tape.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
… as we play for grave stakes the likes of which you have no doubt surmised. Print your move in tomorrow’s paper or I will make it for you.

MUSIC ENDS: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

Dressed in a plaid flannel shirt and khakis, DEPUTY DALE COOPER sits a chair in front of TRUMAN'S desk. COOPER reaches out and shuts off the mini tape player.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ah that tears it, Cooper I’m not letting you out of my sight.

COOPER
Harry if Windom wanted to kill me I’d already be dead.

TRUMAN nods his head for yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

COOPER
Better get Pete on the horn.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

TRUMAN slides the speakerphone unit over to himself and depresses a button.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy call Pete Martell. Get him over here right away. Then call the paper. Find out the latest possible deadline for tomorrow’s personal’s columns.

COOPER places his cup of coffee on top of TRUMAN'S desk and looks at the white mask lying on the table.

MUSIC: QUESTION IN A WORLD OF BLUE (NO VOCALS)

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
(over the intercom) Paper and Pete, got it. I’ll do it alphabetically.

TRUMAN notices that COOPER is starring at the white mask.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

COOPER nods his head for yes slightly and then looks at TRUMAN.

COOPER
She was the love of my life Harry.

COOPER returns to starring at the white mask.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP WHITE MASK

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the delicate white plaster mask of CAROLINE POWELL EARLE'S face lying on TRUMAN'S desk.




DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

As the last scene of the CLOSE-UP on the white mask FADES OUT, we FADE IN to the next scene. Standing in the kitchen, PETE MARTELL talks to LUCY MORAN on the telephone.

PETE
Okay, okay Lucy.

MUSIC ENDS: QUESTION IN A WORLD OF BLUE (NO VOCALS)

PETE
Oh - oh - okay yeah, just - just tell Harry I’ll be right there okay, right.

PETE hangs up the phone. PETE briefly looks over his shoulder and smiles before he picks up two plates of food from the kitchen counter. PETE carries the plates over to the dining room table. Grinning, PETE quietly places one of the plates of food before his wife CATHERINE MARTELL.

We PAN RIGHT as PETE holds the other plate in front of ANDREW PACKARD, who is sitting across the table from his sister CATHERINE. ANDREW erupts into laughter as he sees the plate of food. PETE laughs along with ANDREW. With his white hair a mess and dressed in a robe, having just woken up, ANDREW holds the plate out so that CATHERINE can see it.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP PLATE OF FOOD

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the plate of food ANDREW is holding. The food on the plate is arranged to form a face: two eggs sunny side up with a drop of Tabasco for eyes, cut toast for ears, strips of bacon for a mouth and a single prune for a nose.

ANDREW (OFF SCREEN)
(goading CATHERINE) Huh - huh.


BACK TO SCENE:

CATHERINE is not amused one bit but PETE and ANDREW laugh hysterically. CATHERINE breaks it up by commanding …

CATHERINE
Peter, salt and pepper.

PETE
Comin’ right up Poodle.

PETE walks into the kitchen to fetch a salt and pepper shaker. ANDREW sets his plate down and starts eating. CATHERINE coldly looks over to ANDREW.

CATHERINE
You two bring out the worst in each other.

ANDREW
Oh Pete’s a prince of a man.

CATHERINE
Court jester.

PETE walks back to the table and sets a salt and pepper shaker on top of the table. PETE clasps his hands and announces …

PETE
Well, I got to mosey.

Jokingly, PETE reaches out as if to kiss ANDREW goodbye. ANDREW quickly responds by leaning back, juts his right elbow and growls at PETE. PETE throws out his left shoulder and arm as if to hit ANDREW. The two quickly turn to laughing a little.

PETE walks to the other side of the table, kisses his palm and pats CATHERINE'S chin. PETE walks to the front door, grabs his hat and coat and put his hat and coat on.

PETE
(grinning) Goodbye you sweet Packards.

PETE leaves.

CATHERINE quietly grabs a roll and cuts it with a knife.

ANDREW
Oh Catherine. Catherine I’d always have hope that time and age would mellow that tempest raging inside you.

CATHERINE
Watching you two act like the Hardy Boy’s always brings on stormy weather. What’s happening with Ghostwood?

ANDREW
I talked to the investors. The meeting is set. I leave for Paris tomorrow.

The front door opens.

ANDREW
Ah company.

Wearing a long sleeve plaid flannel jacket and jeans, JOSIE PACKARD steps inside holding a bundle of kindling sticks. JOSIE does not immediately notice ANDREW as she closes the door behind herself.

ANDREW
Dear Josie.

MUSIC: PACKARD THEME    31K

JOSIE stops dead in her tracks as she sees ANDREW, who she thought was dead. Shocked, JOSIE drops the bundle of kindling sticks.

ANDREW
I’m home! Did you miss me?

JOSIE faints and falls to the floor.

ANDREW
Oh she looked surprised.

CATHERINE, relishing the moment, boldly laughs.

CATHERINE
Poor Josie.

ANDREW
Oh she has her charms though.

CATHERINE
Yes, but not for long.

ANDREW erupts into a hard, gasping laughter.

HANK JENNINGS, with the help of crutches, enters TRUMAN’S office. He is followed by DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK’ HILL.

HANK
Hi Harry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Save it Hank.

HANK
What happened? (jokingly) Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning? So I broke parole, cry and eat liver.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You crossed the border into Canada. You consorted with drug dealers at Dead Dog Farm. You tried to kill somebody. I’m charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson

HANK
Ouch. Well I think its safe to assume that I was at the diner the night that Leo was plugged, but you’re welcome to call ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’ve got a witness that puts you at the scene with the gun in your hand.

HANK
Harry you obviously seem serious about this so I’m going to propose a trade. How about information leading to the arrest and conviction of Andrew Packard’s murderer. Hank Jennings' witness ...

HANK snaps his fingers.

HANK
... for the prosecution.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No deals.

HANK
You’re telling me you’re more interested in the attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon, then Andrew Packard? How’s that going to sit with your constituents?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You're through Hank.

HANK
My guess is Harry, not to well. Especially once they find out who pushed the button on Andrew and that you’re sleeping with her.

Teasingly, HANK makes a monkey sound, ‘Ooh-hoo ooh-hoo.’ SHERIFF TRUMAN is furious. Tight lipped, TRUMAN glances over to HAWK. HAWK senses his anger and takes it out on HANK by nonchalantly kicking away HANK’S left crutch. HANK falls face down on TRUMAN’S desk. HAWK pulls HANK up from the collar of his leather jacket.

HAWK
Gee, I’m sorry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Get him out of here.

MUSIC: PACKARD THEME    31K

SHERIFF TRUMAN
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

HAWK picks up HANK'S left crutch off the ground and hands it to HANK.

HANK
I’ll get that.

HANK jerks the crutch away from HAWK. HANK and HAWK leave the room.

Hot headed, SHERIFF TRUMAN punches his right fist into the open palm of his left hand.

ALBERT
This is the one that was excavated from the dead man’s skull.

We ZOOM OUT. In the conference room of the building, DEPUTY COOPER stands next to AGENT ALBERT. ALBERT opens his metal briefcase, tosses the two packets inside and closes the briefcase.

ALBERT
Same bullets, same gun, same killer. Let’s go get her.

COOPER holds his right hand up to halt ALBERT.

COOPER
Albert hold your horses.

ALBERT
Coop, I appreciate any reluctance you might have for busting your pal’s old lady but the woman ventilated you and left you for dead.

COOPER
Albert, I don’t take it personally. What about the gloves, the powder tests?

ALBERT
News at five. Alright, fine you’re not mad but there’s an epidemic of multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around. She is a menace.

COOPER agrees and nods his head for yes.

COOPER
I’ll talk to her. Maybe she’ll confess, turn herself in.

ALBERT
(smartass) Maybe she’ll grow wings and join the circus.

ALBERT jerks his briefcase as he whips it off the conference tabletop and briskly leaves the room.

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the beautiful legs of a WOMAN standing in the lobby of the hotel. We PAN UP. Dressed in a tan business suit, AUDREY HORNE stands in the lobby clutching a manila folder atop of which is a document she briefly glances over.

AUDREY walks up to the concierge desk where the concierge, RANDY ST. CROIX, is seated. RANDY stands up as AUDREY walks up to him and hands him a document.

AUDREY
Randy, I’ve got a list of all our non-repeat guests. We’re going to send them a special invitation to The Great Northern.

RANDY tosses the document to the desktop.

RANDY
Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However, I think you’ll find my job requires a little more than a tight sweater and a perky attitude.

AUDREY
Randy I’m learning the business, every week a different department, I don’t want your job.

RANDY hands AUDREY a nametag.

RANDY
Yes, I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.

RANDY picks up an envelope from the desktop and hands it to AUDREY.

RANDY
This came for you this morning. (somewhat rudely) Good luck Miss Horne. You’ll need it.

RANDY walks off.

Disheartened, AUDREY takes a seat behind the concierge desk and sorts her notebooks on the desktop. She then grabs the nametag and pins it on her suit lapel.

MUSIC: JOHN WHEELER’S THEME    50K

A customer, JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER, walks up to the concierge desk.

JOHN
Hi ya’. I just checked into room 215.

Occupied with a foul mood from her conversation with RANDY, AUDREY fiddles with her nametag. As she ignores the customer, AUDREY grumbles ...

AUDREY
Congratulations.

JOHN
Strange, they told me at the front desk that I should talk to you.

Still not having looked up and seen the customer, AUDREY rudely asks ...

AUDREY
Oh what is it I can do for you?

AUDREY finally looks up and is smitten by JOHN’S handsome looks.

JOHN
Sorry, I thought you were working.

JOHN starts to back off and walk away but AUDREY quickly answers.

AUDREY
I am working. I’m - I’m working. See?

AUDREY fiddles with some notebooks on her desk. JOHN returns to her desk.

JOHN
I see.

JOHN peers at her nametag.

JOHN
Audrey.

AUDREY looks down at her nametag and straightens it. John briefly studies AUDREY'S face and recognizes her.

JOHN
Horne?

AUDREY
At your service.

JOHN
I was wondering if you could send someone out to the airport. I’m traveling with some heavy equipment this trip and didn’t have enough room in the van.

AUDREY
What flight were you on?

AUDREY takes notes on a small black notepad.

JOHN
Uh my own. Uh I have a jet out there it shouldn’t be too hard to find.

AUDREY tilts her head in a saucy fashion.

AUDREY
Is there anything else I can do for you Mr. Rockefeller?

JOHN
Uh no thank you. (smiles) That’s funny.

He starts to walk away but quickly returns and answers.

JOHN
Yeah, I have a picture of you. You’re wearing a little durndurl??? skirt, you’ve got a white apron on you and you’ve got pigtails. Its unbelievably cute.

AUDREY
I don’t wear durndurl(???).

JOHN
You did then. It was right here ... at The Great Northern dining room.

JOHN closes his eyes.

JOHN
Close my eyes - I can almost see it. Little Audrey Horne ... (opens one eye and peers at AUDREY) as Heidi.

Slightly embarrassed, AUDREY peers down at her desk.

JOHN
Well anyway it was unforgettable.

As JOHN turns to walk away, he gazes back at AUDREY for a moment. AUDREY stares at her desktop as she recalls the memory JOHN revealed.

AUDREY
Heidi? I was ten.

AUDREY looks up and sees that JOHN has walked away.

AUDREY
Hey!

In the lobby, JOHN reaches down to the floor, picks up a brochure that an ELDERLY WOMAN has dropped and hands it to her. JOHN waves goodbye to AUDREY with a pair of gloves he holds in his left hand and walks off.

MUSIC ENDS: JOHN WHEELER’S THEME    50K

Disappointed, AUDREY returns her attention to her desktop. She finds the envelope RANDY handed her, rips off the short end's edge of the envelope, props it open and removes the letter from inside.

BIG ED
In love?

NADINE
I hope you're not hurt. I wouldn’t want to hurt you for anything in the world. Honest, you have to believe that, but Mike and I, on that wrestling trip, we had the most magical night together.

NADINE brandishes a distant look with a joyful smile.

BIG ED
(nearly whispered) All night?

NADINE drops the smile and looks at BIG ED.

NADINE
Well you and Norma did it.

BIG ED
Well that’s fair. So, what’s this mean?

NADINE
Eddie, we have to call a spade a spade. We’re breaking up. Eddie, I’m so sorry.

JOSIE stands up, with her back to COOPER.

Dear, you look awful. Is everything alright?

JOSIE puts a hand on her chest and holds herself as she begins to tremble.

JOSIE
I don’t feel very well.

CATHERINE
Oh I’m sorry. I wish I had better news. I’ve spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again on your behalf, but he’s not entirely unsympathetic. He does insist on seeing you alone, tonight.

JOSIE
He’ll kill me.

CATHERINE
To tell you the truth, my biggest worry is what he’s going to do when he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won’t Mr. Eckhardt think that you’ve betrayed him, but of course you can tell him that you didn’t. After all, you did actually think that Andrew was dead.

JOSIE
I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t - know. Maybe you can help me? I think I’m going mad.

CATHERINE walks over to the nearby bookshelf.

CATHERINE
You will simply have to face Mr. Eckhardt, sooner or later. Tell him the truth.

JOSIE looks over to CATHERINE.

Tell him whatever you want.

CATHERINE turns to the bookshelf and removes a book from the bookshelf. JOSIE peers into the cache revealed by CATHERINE. CATHERINE turns back to face JOSIE.

BOBBY
Mr. Wheeler, he must be on his way?

BENJAMIN
Thanks Bobby. Why don’t you join us.

BOBBY tosses the folder to the desktop, picks up his suit jacket and puts it on.

BOBBY
Yeah?

BENJAMIN
Yeah.

BENJAMIN puts an arm around BOBBY and leads him to office entrance where JERRY HORNE and AUDREY are standing.

BENJAMIN
You know, board meetings are usually nothing more then the gathering of self minded individuals.

BEN removes his arm from around BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Each more intent then the other on financial gain.

The four are now huddled together. JERRY offers his drink to his brother BEN.

BENJAMIN
No thanks.

JERRY holds a tray of hors d’oeuvres in his right hand. BOBBY reaches out to grab the tray and JERRY passes it on. As BOBBY scans over the hors d'oeuvres, JERRY points out one he should try.

BENJAMIN
But today, today is going to be something completely different.

The doors to the office open and JOHN WHEELER steps inside.

JOHN
Geez, am I late?

BENJAMIN
Ah.

BEN walks up to JOHN.

JOHN
Hot dog Benjamin.

BENJAMIN
John!

Happily reunited the two welcome each other with a big hug and a pat on the back.

BENJAMIN
You are a sight for sore eyes.

JOHN
Oh look who’s talking.

BENJAMIN
Oh, we’ve taken good care of you?

JOHN
The best.

JOHN looks over to AUDREY.

JOHN
My luggage arrived, thank you Audrey.

AUDREY quietly nods yes. JERRY is stuffing his face with hors d’oeuvres. BEN smiles and points at AUDREY.

BENJAMIN
Ah, you two have met?

AUDREY
Briefly.

BENJAMIN
John Justice Wheeler. Used to be in construction. Came up the hard way.

AUDREY
(slightly sarcastic) How nice.

JOHN feels the remark as he looks over to her.

BENJAMIN
You remember my brother Jerry of course.

Holding the tray of hors d’oeuvres in his right hand and his drink in the left, JERRY walks up to JOHN and offers him an hors d’oeuvre.

JOHN
I missed Jerry. How are you?

JERRY
Hi John.

JOHN grabs an hors d’oeuvre from the tray and holds it in his left hand.

BENJAMIN
And this is uh ... my executive assistant, Bob Briggs.

JOHN
Bob.

BOBBY
Hey what’s up.

JOHN and BOBBY shake hands.

JOHN
Pleasure.

BENJAMIN
Why don’t you all just take a seat.

JERRY, JOHN, AUDREY and BOBBY sit together on the couch in front of BEN'S desk. JOHN continues to hold his hors d’oeuvre in his left hand while JERRY munches away on the hors d’oeuvres on the tray.

BENJAMIN
I’ve uh ... I’ve asked Mr. Wheeler to join us on the board. Years ago I uh ... I made an investment in him. A pittance which he built into an empire.

BEN takes a seat next to his desk.

BENJAMIN
Now, I don’t take any credit but I believed in Jack even when he was a local boy pounding nails. I’ve asked him to return the favor and believe in me now.

JOHN
You're testing my well born modesty.

Unable to speak because his mouth is full, JERRY pats JOHN'S right shoulder and nods approval to him. BEN stands up and moves behind his desk.

BENJAMIN
Alright, suffice to say, Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times. The mill, the Ghostwood lands …

JOHN peers to his left where AUDREY is sitting and glances at her. He returns his attention to BEN.

BENJAMIN
… are now solely owned by Catherine Martell. I don’t begrudge her, the mill was and is after all her’s. So, in spite of these reversals and uh stripped of all …

AUDREY peers to her right and briefly glances at JOHN.

BENJAMIN
… the trappings of success, what are we left with? The human spirit.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:27 - 3:48)

Puzzled, JERRY holds an odd expression as if frozen with a possible answer.

BENJAMIN
What is the greatest gift that one human being can give to another?

BOBBY holds a puzzled but disbelieving expression while AUDREY holds a puzzled but questioning expression.

BENJAMIN
The future. I give you ...

BEN throws the cover off of a large poster on an easel to reveal a black and white picture of a ferret.

BENJAMIN
... the little Pine Weasel.

BOBBY and AUDREY turn to look at each other, worried.

BENJAMIN
Found only in our tri-country area it is nearly extinct.

JERRY
They’re incredible roasted.

BEN clears his throat and points at the poster with his celery stalk as he speaks.

BENJAMIN
According to an environmental impact report, what few Pine Weasels remain will all be but wiped out by the Packard plans for Ghostwood development.

BOBBY
(disbelieving) So you want to uh ... save the weasel?

BEN sits down in a chair in front of the poster.

BENJAMIN
No Bobby, not just the weasel, but life as we know it. I want Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast environmental carnage.

JERRY
So we block Catherine’s development until the wheel turns and we get another shot. That’s brilliant Ben - that’s brilliant.

JERRY shakes his head slightly and laughs. JOHN looks at JERRY'S expression.

BENJAMIN
I plan to fight this Ghostwood development on every ground and with every available weapon.

BEN stands back up and points at the poster with his celery stalk.

BENJAMIN
The little Pine Weasel is about to become a household word.

BEN takes a bite from his celery stalk and walks over to the front of his desk.

AUDREY
Then what?

BENJAMIN
Then ... I am considering ... a run for the senate.

BEN takes another loud, crunchy bite from his celery stalk.

As she does so, she passes WINDOM EARLE who is in a thin disguise as he eats at the island counter. NORMA JENNINGS is on the telephone at the back of the island counter near the service window. WINDOM pays his bill and tosses the tip in change on the counter. Before he quietly leaves, WINDOM leaves behind an envelope addressed to SHELLY JOHNSON.

NORMA
Annie its no problem really. I’ve got plenty of room. Just get on the next bus okay and I will be waiting. (reply) Oh honey don’t cry.

SHELLY returns from the kitchen carrying a large but shallow plastic bin. She stands next to NORMA.

NORMA
Its gonna be alright. I’ll see you soon. (reply) I love you too, bye.

SHELLY
So’s your sister coming?

NORMA
Tomorrow.

SHELLY and NORMA walk over to the area where WINDOM was sitting. They clean up the area by placing the dirty dishes into the bin.

SHELLY
God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?

NORMA
(chuckle) You just leave, its not a prison.

SHELLY
(smiles brightly) Sounds like prison to me: no TV, no boyfriends.

NORMA
You know, when she was little I always used to think that Annie was from another place in time. I guess the convent’s been good for her in a way. Hard to imagine her out in the world.

NORMA spots an envelope on the counter next to the dirty plate.

NORMA
Oh look, there’s something for you.

NORMA hands the envelope to SHELLY.

SHELLY
Who from?

SHELLY
Mountains kiss; waves clasps; flowers, sunlight; the moon beams; is all this; thou not kiss. It doesn’t make sense.


BACK TO SCENE:

SHELLY casts a questioning gaze at NORMA. NORMA quietly looks over the torn segment in SHELLY'S hand. SHELLY reads the note card aloud.

SHELLY
Save the one you love. Please attend a gathering of the angels tonight at the Roadhouse 9:30.

NORMA
It sounds intriguing in a way but it sounds dangerous.

NORMA picks up the tip, left in change, off the counter.

SHELLY
I wonder who this is from.

SHELLY checks the torn segment, the note card and the envelope for a name

The bell at the front door rings as BIG ED walks into the diner. NORMA glows with a wide smile as she spots him. BIG ED walks into the island counter service area by opening the flip-up counter door, walks behind NORMA, twirls her around and caresses her in his arms.

BIG ED
Norma Jennings I’ve loved you every day for the past twenty years and I dream about you every night. Its time for us to be together. Will you marry me?

NORMA
(surprised) Ed?

BIG ED
You deserve it, to be happy. Its our turn babe.

BIG ED holds NORMA close as they passionately kiss.

SHELLY, standing nearby, quietly walks off to give them some privacy but not without checking out the kiss between the two as she sneaks a peak back at them.

Still wearing his disguise from the diner, WINDOM EARLE, wearing a baseball cap, dark blue sweater, jeans and a jacket, walks out of the cabin and up to LEO, singing ...

Mm-hmm. Just a few more and then we’ll eat. (recited dramatically) Fly to my breast, pierce me in colors. Otombno??? speak to me only of love.

WINDOM bends down to look LEO in the eye. LEO mindlessly continues to whittle on another stick of pine.

WINDOM
Leo you have an incomplete education. For instance, survival in the wilderness, ...

WINDOM stands back up.

WINDOM
... a relevant issue in your life my friend.

WINDOM reaches into his jacket pocket and fetches a metal arrowhead point.

Now this comes under the heading of practical instruction. Uh I hope you’ve been paying attention?

WINDOM
Nature is cruel. This is also a lesson.

WINDOM stares at the arrow point as he slowly spins the shaft in his hands.

HANK
Hi ya’ honey.

NORMA moves closes to the bars at HANK'S cell.

NORMA
How are you feeling?

HANK
Well great ... now that you're here.

HANK feigns pain as he stands up and moves to NORMA.

NORMA
Hank I came here to ask you for a divorce.

HANK
Well uh first let me say I don’t blame you. You gave me a second chance and I blew it.

Recognizing his sweetened drivel, NORMA looks away.

HANK
I don’t know why I’m so self destructive, but I can see that that’s my priority in getting well. I’ve got a lot of work to do. In fact I’ve decided I’m going to try to go into therapy. I don’t want to be like this anymore.

NORMA
That’s very interesting Hank, but I have to get on with my life.

Gently, HANK reaches out and holds NORMA'S coat collar.

HANK
I know, I know you do. I just want you to be happy.

NORMA
Thank you.

HANK
I want you to do me one last favor. I want you to help me get out of here. If they send me back to prison I’ll die. I want you to tell the sheriff that I was at the restaurant the night Leo Johnson was shot. I was on my way home. I can’t prove it but you can.

NORMA
No more lies Hank.

HANK
Its not lying, its trying to save my life.

NORMA
No.

HANK
You’re killing me here Norma.

NORMA
Don’t blame this on me, don’t you dare!

HANK
Oh is it Ed?

NORMA looks away.

HANK kisses his finger's and waves her off - a kiss goodbye.

PETE
Now there are four or five different ways of doing this thing, and they all have their virtues.

A tray laden with a variety of donuts sits on the tabletop near the chessboard along with several coffee mugs and a speakerphone. PETE stands at the short end of the conference room table. DEPUTY COOPER is standing to the right of the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN stands on the opposite side of the table. In the background is a chalkboard with a map of the town drawn in chalk.

PETE
Uh I remember Capablanca and Lascer, St. Petersburg 1914, ...

Chomping on a donut, COOPER raises a finger to stop PETE'S babble.

COOPER

PETE
Yeah right.

PETE puts his coffee mug down on the table and slowly sits down in his chair as he looks over the chessboard. TRUMAN touches a switch on the speakerphone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Get the Gazette on the phone. Tell them not to close out the personals. We need more time.

PETE
Okay.

PETE moves a chess piece on the chessboard, P to QN-3.

PETE
That’s it. Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights.

COOPER
As long as he can’t remove another piece from the board.

TRUMAN bends down to look closely at the chessboard.

PETE
He can’t do it, not at least for five - six more moves.

COOPER finishes his donut and wipes his face with a hanky.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Maybe he’ll kill anyway, maybe just frustrate him.

COOPER neatly folds his hanky up and places it in his pants pocket.

COOPER
I don’t think so Harry. Earle has a perverse sense of honor about these things.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.

Outside the conference room, COOPER and ALBERT walk up the hallway as they speak.

ALBERT
Here it is straight up. We’ve got a match on the gun that whacked you with the powder residue on Josie Packard’s gloves. Seattle police have also come up with an eye witness who positively ID Josie leaving the car where they found the stiff. Now if you ain’t going to bust this bitch I would consider it a personal ...

COOPER stops ALBERT in the hall.

ANDREW
We’ve killed enough bottles in our time.

ANDREW raises his glass for a toast.

ANDREW
To beginnings ... and endings and the wisdom to know the difference.

ANDREW takes a drink from his glass.

JOSIE
I ... am sorry Andrew.

JOSIE lowers her head.

ANDREW
I hated you at first of course. Perfectly normal response.

ANDREW takes a seat in a nearby chair in the room and sets his glass down on an adjoining table.

ANDREW
As my anger diminished I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of persuading people to do anything. It was his idea of course?

JOSIE kneels on the ground before ANDREW.

JOSIE
Yes, he made me do it, and he said you never loved me. You just married me to get back at him.

ANDREW
That’s not true, I did love you very much. Of course the same can not be said for you.

JOSIE motions forward for a reply but is cut short.

ANDREW
Please Josie, there will be no more lies between us. You had a job to do and you did it. Now you're paying the price. Every action has its consequence my dear. The police are closing in, if you don’t take action you’ll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.

JOSIE shakes her head for no.

JOSIE
What can I do? Please help me.

ANDREW
You must see Eckhardt.

Again, JOSIE shakes her head for no.

ANDREW
Perhaps you were meant to be together all along. I’m sure he truly loves you. He doesn’t know I’m alive. He can get you out of this country.

DONNA and JAMES take a seat on the picnic sheet.

James, I know what you were feeling. I was feeling it too. Evelyn just took advantage of it.

JAMES
Well it was wrong and I should have known that.

DONNA
Look, its okay for you to feel bad about what happened to you, but I don’t want you to feel bad for me.

JAMES
If we could just start over again.

DONNA
Please come home with me.

I can’t, not right now.

DONNA looks down at the ground.

DONNA
You’re right, you should go.

DONNA looks back up at JAMES and smiles.

Can’t worry about me anymore. I’ve been a part of all the horrible things that have happened. I want to be part of something good now. James go. Take all the time you need.

In a nearly choking gasp, JOSIE holds the gun to her breast. She appears very distraught, pained, gasping for air.

JOSIE collapses to the bed. SHERIFF TRUMAN drops his gun, rushes to her, sits down on the bed beside her, picks her up and holds her close.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?! Josie?

Mystified, COOPER lowers his gun and quietly looks on. TRUMAN looks at JOSIE'S face.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?

TRUMAN looks up at COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
She’s dead.

For a moment, COOPER looks down at the ground in remorse. As COOPER looks back up, the image of TRUMAN holding JOSIE fades away and room becomes dark.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   2K

COOPER is having a vision. A spotlight brightens the room.

BOB
AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! AAGGHHH!!

BOB, the man with long grayish hair and wearing a jean jacket, slithers from underneath the bed and moves to kneel on the edge of the bed.

BOB
AGHH!! HAA - HAA!! COOP, WHAT HAPPENED TO JOSIE!! AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! AGHH!! AGHH!! HAA - HAA - HAA!! AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! HAA - HAA!!

BOB fades away.

The bright spotlight fades away and the room returns to normal as the vision comes to an end. The image of TRUMAN holding JOSIE returns.

COOPER blinks his eyes as he tries to comprehend what he just saw.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh god, Josie?

TRUMAN weeps over the loss of his love as he holds JOSIE in his arms.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh Josie? Oh god. Josie? Oh - ho, oh Josie.

FOCUSING on TRUMAN, we PAN RIGHT to the nightstand beside the bed and ZOOM IN on the drawer pull of the pine wood nightstand.

JOSIE'S face materializes on the knob of the drawer pull. JOSIE cries out, trapped within the confines of the wood. JOSIE'S face extends out of wooden knob, pushing the material outward as if it were plastic. JOSIE'S face turns and contorts as she shrieks and strains to get out.

LOG LADY
Sometimes, well let’s say all times, things are changing. We are judged as human beings on how we treat our fellow human beings. How do you treat your fellow human beings? At night, just before sleep, as you lay by yourself in the dark, how do you feel about yourself? Are you proud of your behavior? Are you ashamed of your behavior? You know in your heart if you have hurt someone, you know. If you have hurt someone, don’t wait another day before making things right. The world could break apart with sadness in the meantime.

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL stands quietly in front of the table TRUMAN is sitting at. Dressed for duty, DEPUTY HAWK holds a plate with a metal cover over it in his right hand and a napkin with silverware in his left hand.

HAWK
One of Norma’s breakfasts, made special.

DEPUTY HAWK puts the plate down on the table in front of TRUMAN and takes the metal cover off to reveal: scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and a small container of ketchup.

Sitting at a round table in a dark corner of the building, holding a shot glass with half a bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey close by, TRUMAN breaks into a soft joyous laughter.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
God bless Norma. Maybe later, maybe later. Thanks. How’s things at the ... station?

HAWK
Earle’s chess game is the big concern. The man has a poor sense of recreation.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

HAWK
We’re holding up, for now.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You and Cooper can handle it. It’s a pretty simple town, used to be. I guess ... the world’s just caught up to us.

HAWK flashes the secret sign of the Bookhouse Boys, an index finger dragged down the temple, and quietly leaves. TRUMAN grabs the whiskey bottle and fills the shot glass.

ANNIE BLACKBURNE, NORMA JENNINGS’S sister with long, wavy blonde hair and blue eyes, steps through the front door of the diner. Carrying a suitcase in one hand and her black purse hanging over her right shoulder, ANNIE, wearing a long black coat, a light-blue shirt and a long plaid skirt, walks into the diner looking for her sister. As ANNIE walks into the diner and heads towards the kitchen she passes MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS at the island counter.

NORMA smiles as she and SHELLY JOHNSON walk out from the kitchen and spot ANNIE.

NORMA
Annie.

NORMA walks up to ANNIE while SHELLY walks over to the short order window to pick up an order.

ANNIE
Hi.

NORMA
Hi.

NORMA and ANNIE hug. NORMA looks over to SHELLY.

NORMA
Shelly, this is my sister Annie.

Holding a plate with a slice of pie, SHELLY pauses in the service area of the island counter near NORMA and ANNIE for greetings.

SHELLY
Hi Annie, welcome. Norma’s told me all about you.

SHELLY walks off to deliver the slice of pie. ANNIE turns to NORMA.

ANNIE
(slightly worried) All about me?

NORMA
Well, Shelly’s like family.

ANNIE
With our family that’s not exactly a character reference.

Facing each other, NORMA and ANNIE take a seat at the island counter.

NORMA
How did you and mom get along?

ANNIE
Well, we can talk about her or feel good about things. I vote for plan B.

NORMA
Me too. I’m glad you’re here.

ANNIE
It feels a little strange.

ANNIE looks around the diner.

ANNIE
The real world. Little things like I’d almost forgotten how to use money. The closest we get in the convent was bingo chips.

ANNIE looks straight eyed at NORMA.

ANNIE
No charity Norma, promise.

NORMA
(smiles) Don’t worry, I’m going to work you till you drop.

ANNIE returns the smile.

We FOCUS on SHELLY as she fills out the bill for MAJOR BRIGGS. Having taken a bite of his pie and now sampling it, MAJOR BRIGGS looks up at SHELLY and critiques the pie.

HAWK
Harry’s about to hit bottom.

COOPER lowers the document.

COOPER
Is he eating?

HAWK nods his head for no. COOPER frowns as he closes the folder holding the document he had been reading. COOPER is wearing a plaid flannel long sleeve shirt and green khakis. A picture of a quarter waning moon sits on a shelf of the bookshelf behind COOPER.

COOPER
When do you think he’ll come back to work?

HAWK
I guess we’ll find out soon.

HAWK looks at the scattering of paperwork across TRUMAN’S desk.

HAWK
You need a hand?

COOPER
That’s a question I should be asking you.

HAWK
You’re the senior lawman Cooper. Let’s just let the rain fall as it has been. Besides, I hate paperwork.

COOPER looks over the scattered paperwork on the desktop.

COOPER
This is worse than the bureau with all this international documentation: Ekhardt, Josie.

COOPER grabs a manila folder from the pile of paperwork.

COOPER
This is the autopsy on her. Doc Hayward said he couldn’t determine cause of death.

COOPER hands the manila folder to HAWK. HAWK reaches out for it.

COOPER
The body only weighed 65 pounds.

HAWK freezes his reach for the folder and looks directly at COOPER.

HAWK
How’s that possible?

COOPER pulls the folder back, marked ’AUTOPSY’ in big red letters, and glances over it before putting it down on the desktop.

COOPER
I don’t know. Maybe something to do with what I saw inside the room when she died.

HAWK
Maybe we better just whistle on our way past the graveyard.

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER picks up his mug of coffee and takes a drink.

HAWK

INT. EARLE’S CABIN - DAY

Illuminating the slightly smoky interior, sunlight filters through the cracks of the warped boards of the cabin’s walls. Twirling a flower with white petals in the grip of his left hand, WINDOM EARLE sits in a sofa chair pinching his nose with his right hand as he practices his breathing exercises. LEO JOHNSON, wearing pajamas and a red robe, walks up to EARLE carrying a pair of slippers.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

LEO
(whispered) Slip.

WINDOM
Slippers.

Holding his breath, WINDOM points to the ground to show LEO where to put his slippers. LEO quietly complies and drops the slippers on the floor next to WINDOM’S feet. LEO wanders off.

MUSIC ENDS: JAPANESE FLUTE    53K

WINDOM
You know Leo, you can’t really appreciate how tonic country life is until you’re actually right here (deep breath) living it.

LEO returns and juts a smoking pipe in front of WINDOM’S face, surprising him.

WINDOM
Pipe, splendid.

WINDOM takes his pipe from LEO. LEO walks off. WINDOM puts the pipe in his mouth and blows on it.

WINDOM
Hmm.

WINDOM puts the pipe away in his shirt pocket and looks down at the flower he holds in his hands as he spins it in his fingertips by its stem.

WINDOM
Even if you’ve been to the country before, when you try to image what it would be like to go back the ... image is imperfect.

WINDOM pulls one of the petals off.

WINDOM
(slightly angry) The mental image is always imperfect.

WINDOM throws the petal away. LEO walks up to WINDOM holding a newspaper. WINDOM looks up at LEO.

WINDOM
Am I right?

Still holding the newspaper, LEO stands quietly looking down at WINDOM. WINDOM lowers his gaze to the flower and grins.

WINDOM
A passive agreement is acceptable Leo. Your silence speaks volumes.

WINDOM looks up at LEO.

WINDOM
Or if not volumes at least the occasional, punctuated paragraph, heh.

WINDOM puts the flower down.

WINDOM
Well, lets see what move our poor Cooper has come up with this time.

With the RUFFLING of newsprint, WINDOM rips the newspaper from LEO’S grip and opens the newspaper to the classifieds section. As WINDOM looks for the ad, LEO takes a seat next to WINDOM.

WINDOM
Uh-huh.

WINDOM finds the ad, reads the move, hastily folds the newspaper and holds on to it as he leans over to a nearby chessboard and moves a black pawn to queens-knight three. LEO stares at the chessboard.

WINDOM
(quickly realizes) This isn’t a move. This is a trick. He’s playing a stalemate game. Cooper doesn’t know the meaning of STALEMATE!

Furious, WINDOM swings the folded newspaper and whacks LEO hard. A distant SCREECH from an eagle bellows from outside the cabin.

WINDOM
He’s getting help.

WINDOM slams the folded newspaper to the ground and grabs his Japanese flute lying next to the chair. Holding the flute at its tip in his fist in his lap, WINDOM waves the flute in the air.

WINDOM
I can not tolerate people who do not play by the rules. People who shirk THE STANDARDS!

MUSIC ENDS: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

Using the Japanese flute as a cudgel, WINDOM leashes out his anger by cracking LEO on the head and striking his chest. LEO winces in pain and shies away in fear but remains seated next to WINDOM. WINDOM returns to waving the flute from his lap.

WINDOM
Many people are going to regret this.

WINDOM takes a deep breath and shakes off his foul mood. WINDOM moves the flute to his lips and plays a tune.

AUDREY walks up to DICK, who is still starring at the MODELS.

AUDREY

DICK turns to face AUDREY.

AUDREY

DICK gives a questioning gaze.

AUDREY

In the background, MR. TIM PINKLE slowly makes his way towards DICK and AUDREY.

DICK
Ohh, lovely. What is it, a raccoon or something?

AUDREY
A ferret.

Holding a stuffed model of a ferret, MR. PINKLE walks up to AUDREY.

MR. PINKLE

AUDREY
Ah great. You two should coordinate.

DICK

DICK rolls his eyes and walks away. Puzzled, MR. PINKLE follows after DICK. AUDREY opens her day planner and takes a note. Occupied with her day planner, AUDREY turns around and nearly walks into JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER, who is standing nearby watching the commotion in the Timber Room.

Several portable card tables, topped with chess sets, are scattered in the reception area. A poster of a chessboard hangs on the wall and several boxes of chess sets are scattered in the area.

PETE
... you wind up with six pieces. Now I can improve on that but even if I get there in half the time and wind up with twelve ... that means ... six people die.


CLOSE ON: COOPER’S FACE

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME   

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER’S face.

COOPER
Do your best Pete. Windom Earle’s genius carries with it the vice of impatience. He doesn’t want pawns he wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the queen. Then we can frustrate him.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
You can’t do that.

COOPER looks to his left.

BACK TO SCENE:

Inside LUCY MORAN’S reception office, LUCY and DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN are playing a game chess. ANDY sits huddled over the chessboard as LUCY stands and talks to PETE through the open window of the reception office.

LUCY
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight without doing the little hook thing.

ANDY
You don’t have to do the little hook thing, that’s optional.

PETE
Andy, the knight has to do the little hook thing.

ANDY looks at PETE.

ANDY
Every time?

PETE
It’s a privilege. No one else gets to make that move.

ANDY
Okay Mr. Martell.

ANDY corrects his move on the chessboard.

LUCY
I guess some people don’t know quite as much as they think they do.

LUCY moves a piece on the chessboard.

LUCY

LOG LADY
My log noticed, I remember.

COOPER
What do you remember Margaret?

LOG LADY
Look at the back of my leg.

The LOG LADY shifts in her seat to show COOPER the back of her right leg. COOPER walks up to the LOG LADY and looks at a scar on the back of her leg just below the knee. Perplexed, COOPER returns to the chalkboard to draw an image of the scar.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:30)

MUSIC: THE MILL FIRE    16K

To the left of the sketch of the three triangles, COOPER draws the image of the LOG LADY’S scar, a simple drawing of two mountain peaks that mirror each other.

LOG LADY
I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods and when I got back I was told that I had disappeared for a day. All I could recall was a flash of light and that mark was on my leg.

MAJOR BRIGGS speaks animatedly by waving his left hand.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We all three recall the light.

LOG LADY
And also ... the call of the owl.

COOPER
Yes, I remember.

LOG LADY
The only other time I ... I saw that sign and heard that sound was right before my husband died ... in a fire.

COOPER stands quietly next to the chalkboard with the two sketches. MAJOR BRIGGS and the LOG LADY stare at the two sketches. COOPER turns to face the sketches on the chalkboard. MAJOR BRIGGS points at the chalkboard.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m connecting with something.

LOG LADY
Yes.

COOPER
What?

LOG LADY

Ah, no one’s ever sung a song to me before.

JOHN
You must have been serenaded at least once or twice?

AUDREY chortles.

AUDREY
I don’t inspire much singing. Most boys are afraid.

JOHN
Well they don’t know you then, not really.

AUDREY
I don’t think anybody really knows me.

JOHN
Sounds like a warning.

AUDREY
I know.

JOHN
Look, if there’s another guy.

AUDREY
Ssshh. There was someone but ... not anymore. There’s nobody.

JOHN
So what do you want to do now?

JOHN grins.

AUDREY
Do you know any more cowboy tricks?

JOHN smiles.

JOHN
If you have a lariat in that picnic basket I could lasso passing cattle.

AUDREY chortles.

AUDREY
I don’t think there’s a cow for miles.

JOHN
Stray dogs? Raccoons? Birds? ... (wide-eyed) Weasels?

AUDREY laughs.

We view a WIDE-SHOT of the area. As the day draws to a close, the sun casts an orange glow. Near the shore of the lake, AUDREY and JOHN sit on a checkered picnic blanket with a picnic basket of food next to them. In the lake, ducks swim by and QUACK. AUDREY reaches into the picnic basket, pulls out a green apple and holds it out for JOHN to take a bite. JOHN takes a bite and struggles slightly to bite through the apple. JOHN reaches out to support the apple but is able to chomp through.

DONNA
You had a visitor.

DR. HAYWARD
Who’s that?

DR. HAYWARD puts the bag of groceries down on the dining room table.

DONNA
Somebody you went to medical school with named Gerald Craig.

DR. HAYWARD
Gerald Craig?

DR. HAYWARD gives a puzzled look to EILEEN and then turns back to DONNA.

DR. HAYWARD
That’s not possible Donna.

DONNA
Well yeah, he said he was on his way to a convention in Spokane. He knew everything about me.

Puzzled, DR. HAYWARD and EILEEN look at each other.

DONNA
Here’s his number and this.

DONNA hands DR. HAYWARD the small black box and the note card WINDOM gave her. DR. HAYWARD opens the note card and briefly reads it before passing it to EILEEN. EILEEN picks up the phone and dials the phone number on the card.

DR. HAYWARD
Gerald Craig was my roommate. He drowned on a rafting trip on the Snake River. I was there Donna, I tried to save him.

DONNA
Well then?

DR. HAYWARD removes the white string from the small black box. Baffled by the response on the telephone, EILEEN remarks ...

NADINE smiles.

NADINE
Its so cute the way you get embarrassed.

BIG ED
And uh ... since I have now found someone else ... Nadine I’m not sure you’re going to understand this.

NADINE
Of course I understand Eddie. This isn’t just a little spat.

DR. JACOBY leans over to NADINE.

DR. JACOBY
Nadine uhm ... do you know what Ed is suggesting?

NADINE
Its not too obvious. We’re not like talking relativity here. We’re breaking up. Major, final breakup.

DR. JACOBY
Well ... yes, technically I guess it - it is a breakup but uh ...

BIG ED
Well it’s a little more than that Nadine.

Uncomfortable, BIG ED stares at DR. JACOBY.

NADINE
Ed, you are so serious. These are the dating years. You’re acting like it some really big deal.

BIG ED wrings his hands together.

BIG ED
Doc?

DR. JACOBY leans close to BIG ED.

DR. JACOBY
Ed, there are no secrets tricks or magic words. It - its like the dissolving of - of scar tissue around a wound. She’ll start to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.

BIG ED
Well when will that be?

DR. JACOBY
Well I can’t say. That tissue’s packed in there pretty hard.

BIG ED and DR. JACOBY turn to NADINE as she speaks.

NADINE
Okay, well one thing I really don’t want to see Ed. Are any incidents with Mike. No jealous rages. Well, maybe just one.

NADINE smirks with a smile but quickly looses the smirk as her eyes start to widen. BIG ED looks at DR. JACOBY.

BIG ED
I give up.

DR. JACOBY
Nadine, you and Ed are about to get a divorce.

NADINE raises her left hand and puts it in front of her left eye, the eye with the black patch over it.

NADINE

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

MUSIC: COUNTRY #5

We PAN UP from the floor of the island counter service area. Sitting at the island counter bar, NORMA smiles as she reads her mail. The letter NORMA is reading is an announcement for the Miss Twin Peaks pageant. NORMA turns the letter around so that the ad faces her.

NORMA
Shelly?

SHELLY stands bent over near the short order window as she fills out an order on her tab.

SHELLY
Yeah.

SHELLY walks over to NORMA.

NORMA
Have you seen this?

NORMA turns the letter around to show SHELLY. SHELLY reads the heading out loud.

SHELLY
Miss Twin Peaks.

NORMA’S eye’s brighten and she gestures to the letter by shaking the letter. NORMA wants SHELLY to take an interest in the pageant. SHELLY throws her head back as she scoffs at the ad.

SHELLY
Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me?

NORMA
There’s a cash prize and a scholarship. And I bet you could walk away with it.

NORMA folds the letter up. SHELLY shakes her head for no and rolls her eyes.

SHELLY
I don’t think so.

NORMA
Its easy, you give a speech, you answer a few questions.

SHELLY picks up a nearby spoon and holds it to her mouth like a microphone.

SHELLY
(wide-eyed, bold) Miss Double R Diner, what would you do to bring about world peace?

SHELLY smiles and thrusts the spoon/microphone towards NORMA as if to record her remark. SHELLY returns the spoon/microphone to her mouth and playfully speaks in a higher tone of voice.

SHELLY
Well, I would bring all the world leaders together, make them form a circle and join hands. Cause you can’t make a fist holding hands.

SHELLY cocks her head to the side and smiles.

NORMA
You’re a shoo-in.

SHELLY
I have an order up.

SHELLY clicks her heels as she walks away to pick up a plate at the short order window. After picking up the plate, SHELLY continues to joke around about the pageant by holding her hands up, palms up and sashay across the floor. Enjoying the prank, NORMA smiles at her the whole time.

SHELLY walks up the island counter service area on the opposite side of the counter where NORMA is seated. WINDOM EARLE sits at the counter disguised as a biker: black t-shirt, black bandana on his head, one black fingerless glove on his right hand and a long haired wig.

SHELLY
Here’s your burger.

SHELLY puts a plate with a hamburger and fries down on the counter in front of WINDOM. WINDOM holds his mug of coffee near his mouth, cupped in both hands.

WINDOM
What’s with the dance?

SHELLY
Oh - uh, my boss told me I should enter a pageant, Miss Twin Peaks.

WINDOM
Now you can kid about it but uh ...

WINDOM points at SHELLY.

WINDOM
... you are very pretty. I think you should enter.

SHELLY
Thanks but I don’t think of myself as pretty.

WINDOM gestures to his chest.

WINDOM
That’s an inner thing, you know.

SHELLY smiles politely and then quietly walks off. WINDOM watches SHELLY walk off as he holds his mug of coffee close to his face. The front door to the diner RINGS, as some enters the building. WINDOM shifts his gaze from SHELLY to the person entering the diner.

Behind the island counter, ANNIE, dressed in one of the diner’s blue waitress uniforms, walks up to COOPER.

ANNIE
Would you like something to drink?

COOPER looks up from his book and is immediately smitten at the sight of ANNIE.

COOPER
Yes, I’d like a ... cup of deep black joe please.

ANNIE
Coming right up.

ANNIE bends down and fetches a saucer with a coffee cup from a shelf below the counter. ANNIE puts the saucer with the inverted coffee cup on the counter next to COOPER. COOPER and ANNIE both reach out to turn the coffee cup right side up. ANNIE stops short of picking the cup up and looks at COOPER. COOPER smiles and pulls his hand back. ANNIE reaches out, picks up the cup and turns it right side up.

ANNIE bends down to fetch some utensils from the shelf under the counter. COOPER nervously fidgets his left arm as looks up at ANNIE, to the coffee cup and then back at ANNIE as she stands up.

COOPER
You must be Norma’s sister.

ANNIE stops and looks at COOPER.

ANNIE
I’m Annie. How’d you know?

COOPER extends his right hand out to shake hands with ANNIE.

COOPER
Dale Cooper, local law enforcement.

ANNIE shakes hands with COOPER.

ANNIE
Must keep you pretty busy.

COOPER
Sure does.

For a second there is an awkward moment of silence. COOPER interrupts before ANNIE walks off to get the pot of coffee.

COOPER
Are you uh ... staying in town for awhile?

ANNIE

TRUMAN laughs and waves his revolver into the air.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

A totem pole is decorated with small flashing white lights. We FAVOR ON BEN as we PAN RIGHT. The room is packed with people.

BEN and the crowd CLAP their hands. DICK walks out from behind the curtain and up to the microphone and bumps into BEN as he walks away from the microphone to head off behind the curtain. DICK adjusts the height of the microphone.

DICK
Oops. Thank you, splendid gathering.

A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a photograph of DICK.

LUCY stops spinning and wavers slightly under the loss of balance from spinning. LUCY walks down the catwalk towards the curtain.

DICK
That’s fabulous isn’t it. A moonless night black, slim skirt for the look that always says, Hey world, I’m here.

Facing the audience, LUCY stands posed at the curtain. Finished, DICK motions LUCY to move along. LUCY raises her hand, sets a pose and then slips behind the curtain.

DICK
Mr. Brennan is wearing a fire engine red ...

ANDY steps out from behind the curtain and walks, rather stiffly, up the catwalk starring bug-eyed at the audience.

DICK

ANDY remains standing at the end of the catwalk starring at the crowd.

DICK
That’s it Andy.

ANDY turns around and walks down the catwalk towards the curtain. The audience CLAP their hands. ANDY pauses at the curtain and, with a blank expression, turns to DICK. DICK gestures with a head nod to the curtain for ANDY to leave. ANDY shakes his head and then walks behind the curtain.

We FOCUS on AUDREY as MODEL #4 gets up from the chair and heads off to the catwalk.

AUDREY
Go, go - go - go.

Another MODEL takes a seat in the chair in front of the mirror.

We FOCUS on BEN standing near the corner of the bar in the Timber Room as he dunks a cookie into a glass of milk. CATHERINE MARTELL walks up to the bar and takes a seat on a stool behind BEN.

CATHERINE
Well if it isn’t John York, friend of the redwoods.

BEN turns around to see CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
Catherine, how good of you to come.

BEN eats his cookie.

CATHERINE
Ben darling who you kidding with all this?

BENJAMIN
I am absolutely, one-hundred percent sincere.

CATHERINE
Oh come on, look who you’re talking to. We’re in the same line of work. You’ve always been a little more obvious but this?

BENJAMIN
Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an experience that truly changed you?

BEN takes a sip from his glass of milk.

CATHERINE
Please, spare me the born again sales pitch and level with me. You can’t help to stop my development plans so what do you actually expect to gain from all this?

BEN grins.

BENJAMIN
A first scrubbing ... on one of the dirtiest consciences in the entire Northwest. And hopefully, it will happen to you.

BEN removes his glasses and bends close to CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
(softly) Catherine, I know what your plans for Ghostwood are and granted I used to see life exactly the way you do and no matter how many deals I make or how much money I make, inside I was still a black, miserable clod of dirt. I am finding that the one thing that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic thing is giving. Don’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to find that out.

CATHERINE
God help you. You actually sound like you mean it.

BENJAMIN
I do, for you, for me, the future. Catherine, why don’t you take this opportunity to transcend a lifetime of megalomania and egocentricity and write us a big, fat check to help stop Ghostwood.

CATHERINE boldly laughs. BEN joins CATHERINE’S laughter with a chuckle of his own. BEN walks around CATHERINE, kisses her cheek and walks away. CATHERINE is puzzled.

MUSIC ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED

We FOCUS on a WIDE-SHOT of the crowd and the catwalk in the Timber Room. DICK and the crowd CLAP as the last MODEL leaves the catwalk and walks backstage.

DICK
And now to introduce you to an endangered little critter who’s home is presently under attack by the proposed Ghostwood development project, Mr. Tim Pinkle.

DICK awaits MR. PINKLE’S entrance from the curtain door but MR. PINKLE walks up to DICK from the corner of the stage carrying a metal cage.

MR. PINKLE
Thank you kids. Thank you, thank you.

MR. PINKLE puts the cage down on the floor and, smiling brightly, moves to the microphone.

MR. PINKLE
Well hi, how’s everything goin’?


MR. PINKLE POV:

Through MR. PINKLE’S POV, the audience remains quiet.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
That’s good. Uhm ladies and gentlemen, I have with me a little fella’ who doesn’t understand the peril that awaits him. (dramatic) An innocent in a world gone mad. A world ...

DICK throws his left shoulder forward and nudges MR. PINKLE’S back to move on. MR. PINKLE gets the message and skips the growing dramatic presentation.

MR. PINKLE
... gone mad. And without further adieu, ladies and gentlemen, I - I give you the endangered pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE bends down to the metal cage on the floor, opens it and pulls out a live pine weasel. MR. PINKLE stands back up and shows the pine weasel to the audience.

MR. PINKLE
Now this species is of the weasel family and not only is he non-aggressive to us humans and has beau-ti-ful fur ...

MR. PINKLE strokes the fur on the back of the pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE
... but also he is by nature an excellent controller of rodents. Unfortunately this little friendly fella’ is incredibly curious making him very easy for one to trap.

The pine weasel worms its way to face a large white campaign button pinned on DICK’S lapel. MR. PINKLE follows the pine weasel’s attention to the button.

MR. PINKLE
He is also attracted to bright, shiny objects.

The pine weasel worms its way to face the buttons of DICK’S shirt.

DICK
Must - must be my - my studs.

The pine weasel continues to wiggle its way in MR. PINKLE’S grasp to move to DICK’S chin.

MR. PINKLE
Yeah, oh ... and also, it is amazing, he is particularly attracted to various smells like, believe it or not, very cheap cologne.

MR. PINKLE follows the pine weasel’s attention to DICK’S face.

MR. PINKLE
Oh, what’s this - what’s ... I think he want to give you a kiss Dick.

DICK
Oh please Mr. Pinkle.

MR. PINKLE
Come on, come on.

DICK looks towards the audience and smiles.


DICK’S POV:

Through DICKS’ POV, the audience quietly sits.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
Its alright give him a kiss.

DICK
A kiss?

MR. PINKLE moves the pine weasel closer to DICK’S face. A bit weary, DICK leans back and stretches his left hand out near the pine weasel as if to grasp it.

MR. PINKLE
Oh come on. Atta boy.

DICK
Hello there little pilgrim.

MUSIC ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED

MUSIC: A???

The pine weasel BITES DICK on the nose. DICK SHOUTS and arches backward.

DICK
AHHH!!!

The pine weasel slips out of MR. PINKLE’S grasp as it remains clamped to DICK’S nose.

MR. PINKLE
No ... no ...

With the pine weasel clamped to his nose, DICK runs up the catwalk SHOUTING in pain. MR. PINKLE follows DICK, trying to recapture the pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE
No ... no ...

DICK pulls the pine weasel off the end of his nose and throws it down into the audience. The pine weasel lands on someone’s dinner plate. The PATRONS at that table panic, turn the table over as they rush to stand up and run away from the loose weasel. The pine weasel lands on the floor.

MUSIC ENDS: A???

MUSIC: B???

EVERYONE panics, stands up and runs around the room. Holding his nose, DICK runs backstage. A few people from the audience follow DICK backstage.

MR. PINKLE
Don’t panic. He’s completely harmless. He’s already endangered.


PINE WEASEL’S POV:

Through the pine weasel’s POV we get a jostled view close to the ground. People’s feet can be seen as they rush about the room.


BACK TO SCENE:

Amid people running by, the pine weasel scampers along the floor.


PINE WEASEL’S POV:

Through the pine weasel’s POV we bounce along the floor and come upon a PATRON, who is scared, lying flat on the floor.

PATRON #1
Oh no, ahhh!


BACK TO SCENE:

ANDY and LUCY walk out from backstage and up the catwalk.

ANDY
Don’t - don’t panic anybody. Just don’t panic.

People continue to run around the room. Part of the structure holding up the curtain falls as people rush backstage. AUDREY rushes from backstage and up to the microphone near the catwalk.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
Nobody panic.

AUDREY
Everyone, calm down. Stay in your seat.

A MODEL, screaming in hysteria, rushes past the partially fallen curtain and knocks AUDREY off the catwalk platform. JOHN WHEELER catches AUDREY in his arms.

JOHN
You alright?

Stunned, AUDREY stares into JOHN’S eyes.

AUDREY
Fine.

JOHN
A lot of fuss over a loose weasel.

AUDREY
Maybe we should help?

JOHN
I don’t know, looks like it might do this crowd some good.

AUDREY
Did - did you come for the fashion show?

JOHN
No, I came for you.

Carrying AUDREY in his arms, JOHN and AUDREY kiss amidst the confusion in the room.


CLOSE ON: MODEL

Standing at the end of the catwalk, the MODEL SCREAMS at the top of her lungs in hysteria.

INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME   


JONES’S POV:

Through JONES’S POV, the door to the room opens and we step inside. With his back to the door, a BOOKHOUSE BOY sits in a nearby chair reading a book. We quietly move closer and closer to the BOOKHOUSE BOY. JONES throws her left hand down hard on the side of the neck of the BOOKHOUSE BOY. The BOOKHOUSE BOY is knocked out cold, unconscious.

We move beside the bed where SHERIFF TRUMAN is sleeping. JONES puts a handgun down on a nearby table.


BACK TO SCENE:

JONES stands beside SHERIFF TRUMAN’S bed and removes a black scarf draped over her head. JONES unbuttons her black blouse and removes it to reveal a black silk slip. Next, JONES unbuttons and removes her skirt and removes a clip that bunches her hair at the back of her neck. JONES lifts the covers on the bed and slips into bed.

FADE IN:

1. INT. BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

Truman in a cot turns restlessly in his drunken sleep. He rolls over. A naked woman snuggles close to him. In Truman's dreams it is Josie.

TRUMAN
Josie -

Truman kisses the woman who responds. It is JONES. She moves under the sheets. Massaging. Whispers.

JONES
Do you like that?

TRUMAN
Yes, Josie. Yes.

Jones' hands slide under him - massaging. Then she rolls over on top of Truman who responds with passion. The wheeze of the wire from the BRACELET GAROTTE wakes Truman. She tightens the strangle line around his neck while she sits on top of him.

Jones bends over him and kisses him passionately. Truman uses this moment to flip her off him. But at the same time Jones pulls the magnesium wire tighter. Truman fights to breathe and free her hands from the garotte.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Truman manages to stand. Jones wraps her legs around him. Truman tears at her trying to get a grip. Carrying her to a wall, Truman pounds her again and again against it. Jones is nearly unconscious. Finally, her hands drop away from him. Truman keeps pounding, about to kill her. Then stops himself. Looks down at the naked woman lying below him.
CUT TO:


2. INT. GREAT NORTH

JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER pores over some books, maps, and in elaborate model for a complicated irrigation system. A knock on the door.

FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
Room service.

WHEELER
It's open.

The door opens. Wheeler remains completely absorbed in what he is doing. Not noticing that it is AUDREY HORNE who brings in his breakfast. Without looking up he retrieves a money clip to give her a tip. Then notices it is Audrey. Surprised and pleased.

WHEELER
Audrey.

AUDREY (seductress relapse)
I trust your sleep was untroubled? Here at the Great
Northern, we aim to make your stay as comfortable and
enjoyable as we can - we take the concept of room
service very seriously -

Wheeler comes over to the bed, gently puts a finger to her lips to silence her.

WHEELER
Audrey ... did you know your grandfather?
(fingers still on her lips, becoming caress)
Colorful old guy, but the wisest man I've ever met. He
always used to say, "If you bring a hammer, you better
bring nails."

AUDREY (taking his fingers in hand)
What's that supposed to mean?

WHEELER
It means the next time you come into my room and sit
on my bed and carry on like this you had better be ready
to finish whatever it is you're trying to start.

AUDREY
Maybe I'm ready now.

WHEELER (simply)
Then be yourself.

AUDREY
This is myself.

WHEELER
You're a beautiful, intelligent, young woman. You don't
have to sneak in here and flirt like a high school girl.

Audrey fixes Wheeler with an challenging stare. Then:

AUDREY
(mimicking Wheeler)
"If you bring a hammer, you better bring nails."
(beat)
I'm not the only one who flirts.

WHEELER (beat, he smiles)
You're right. I stand corrected.

AUDREY
This could get confusing.

WHEELER
Why?

AUDREY (with humor)
Well, if I'm always worrying about being myself, and
you're always worrying, and I'm checking to see if you're
being yourself, but then you've got to keep an eye on you
too...

WHEELER
We'll be lucky if we can carry on a simple conversation.

AUDREY (her point exactly)
Yep.

WHEELER (beat, he moves closer)
Audrey, I have a plan. It involves a plane ride at sunset
and dinner for two.

AUDREY
What? When?

WHEELER
The sunset part or the dinner part?

AUDREY (she moves closer too)
I've got to go to the library, and my father wanted to
meet with me some time today -

WHEELER
If you're busy I'll understand...

AUDREY
Yes. I mean yes I'm busy. And yes I'll go.

They kiss.

3. INT. SHERIFFS STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM DAY

Truman exits the room where Jones sits at the table, meets Cooper in the hallway.

COOPER
Anything?

TRUMAN
Not a word. Wants to speak to the South African
counsulate.

COOPER
My guess would be there's a half-dozen countries
looking to extradite her.

TRUMAN
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?

COOPER
Sexual jealousy.

TRUMAN
(as if he hadn't considered it)
Oh yeah.

COOPER
You think he needed a more rational reason? It's good
to have you back, Harry.

TRUMAN
(a hell of a hangover)
Take me a day or so to get my sea legs.

COOPER
To be honest, Harry you look like hell. Maybe you
ought to recuperate at home.

TRUMAN
All I need's some coffee and maybe some food.

Cooper stops him.

COOPER
Sure cure for a hangover, Harry. You start with a nearly
frozen, unstrained glass of tomato juice. Drop a couple
of oysters in there and chug it down. Breathe deeply.
Next a heaping mound of sauteed sweetbreads with
chestnuts and Canadian bacon. Finally some biscuits and
a bucket of gravy, and here's where it gets tricky, you're
gonna need some anchovies -

Truman, growing green, stops him outside the men's room door.

TRUMAN
Excuse me.

Truman rushes into the bathroom. Cooper, having acheived the desired stomach-pump effect, gives a thumbs-up.
CUT TO:


4. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Cooper enters to find DOC HAYWARD admiring a BONSAI TREE that sits on Truman's desk. A bow is wrapped around the base of the plant.

DOC
Multi-trunk bonsai. The ultimate miniature.

A shakey Truman enters a moment later, Cooper hands him a glass.

COOPER
Bicarbonate of soda.

TRUMAN
Thanks. Where'd this come from?

Truman takes the card from the plant. Reads it. Grows even paler.

COOPER
It was delivered this morning.

TRUMAN
It's from Josie.

Truman sits down trying to hold onto his composure. To Cooper, Doc indicates the package that Windom Earle left at his house, which Cooper has already seen. Cooper gets the message: involve Harry. He urges Doc to speak.

DOC
Harry, Windom Earle was at my house.

TRUMAN
Windom Earle was?

DOC
He left this with Donna.

Truman takes out a chess piece that is tagged with a chess move. It reads "Kn to KB3." Another note reads "Trying for a Stalemate?"

TRUMAN
What do we do?

COOPER
We've got to publish our next move today.

COLE'S VOICE
DALE COOPER, A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES IF EVER
THERE WAS ONE. GIMME THE GLAD HAND.

Gordon Cole moves into the room.

COLE
HEY, FELLAS. I BROUGHT THE REST OF THE
WINDOM EARLE DOSSIER.

He hands Cooper a large folder. As Cole continues we MOVE IN on the Bonsai plant. Closer and closer till an ELECTRONIC BUG is visible.
INTERCUT:


5. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

WINDOM EARLE fiddles with a deck of cards, as he sits and listens to the conversation. LEO JOHNSON, filthy rag over his arm ala a butler, pours Earle a drink from a can of beer.

EARLE
Enter Gordon Cole. This is so galling, Leo. Young
Dale is continually refusing to play fair.
INTERCUT:


TRUMAN'S OFFICE

As Cooper flips through Earle's file, Cole narrates.

COOPER
Medical report?

COLE
WHEN EARLE WENT BOY - YOY - YOING THE
DOCTORS DISCOVERED HE WAS ON
HALOPERIDOL.

DOC
The drug the one armed man, Gerard, was on.

COLE
YOU GOT IT. BUT THEY SUSPECT HE WAS
USING IT TO FAKE HIS ILLNESS. DEFINITE
SCHIZOID MANEUVERING.

Cooper stares at the next file. Flipping a page back and forth. Confused and fearful.

COOPER
"Project Blue Book." How could he have been working on that..?

COLE
WE LOANED HIM OUT TO THE AIR FORCE
IN '65. REPORTS ON HIS TWO-YEAR HITCH
ARE BLACKED OUT. NATIONAL SECURITY.

TRUMAN (picking up on Cooper's concern)
Wait a minute, Earle was investigating UFO's?

Another worry for the group.

COOPER
Some curious linkages here, Gordon.

COLE
THE WORD LINKAGE REMINDS ME OF
SAUSAGES. NEVER LIKED LINK SAUSAGES,
THOUGH. PREFER PATTIES. BREAKFAST IS
A GOOD IDEA.
(moves to the plant)
BONSAI. REMEMBER THOSE WORLD WAR
TWO MOVIES?
(right next to the plant)
BONSAI.

EARLE'S CABIN

Cole's yelling has buried the needle. The cards shoot out of Earle's hands. He brings his hands to his ears.

EARLE
Damnation.

TRUMAN'S OFFICE

Doc and Truman exit. Cole watches them go. Pulls Cooper back and gives him a package. Cooper reaches into the package. He takes out his BADGE, GUN, and CREDENTIALS.

COLE
KEEP THIS ON THE QT, COOP, BUT WITH
EARLE ROLLING AROUND LOOSE ON DECK,
WE NEED YOU BACK ON THE TEAM.
(Cooper looks at the gun)
BRAND NEW ISSUE. MORE ACCURATE AND
EFFICIENT. SMITH AND WESSON, TEN
MILLIMETER. MOD 1076. ALL STAINLESS
STEEL. IT'S QUITE A BEAUTIFUL WEAPON.

COOPER
(takes out his badge, studies it)
Thank you, Gordon.

COLE
WE'RE GOING TO FIND EARLE, COOP. WE
WILL PURSUE, CAPTURE, AND
INCARCERATE.

Cooper peers at Cole for a beat. Then, quite serious, gives him the Bureau thumb's up.

6. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

Earle shuffles a deck of cards in front of Leo, then spreads them before him.

Pick three cards, Leo.

Leo picks cards out of the deck. Earle flips the cards over. THREE QUEENS. On the faces are pictures of DONNA, SHELLY, and AUDREY.

EARLE
Good. Now find the king.

Leo picks another card and flips it over. A king is there with Cooper's face glued on it.

EARLE
And now we need one more Queen.

Earle picks out a Queen without a face.

EARLE
The Queen of Hearts.

He picks up a brochure for the MISS TWIN PEAKS CONTEST.

EARLE
Miss Twin Peaks. What do you get if you win. A
dozen roses, a college scholarship, the accolades of your
peers...
(picks up the queen without a face)
Oh and I know you got to die. A royal execution.

Earle spreads the rest of the deck out.

EARLE
And Cooper gets to watch.

Flips them all over on their faces. They are all JOKERS.

Unbelievable.

Donna comes up to the desk.

DONNA
Is Audrey Horne here?

DESK CLERK
She's in back, I'll get her for you.

MIKE
(no hint of worry, a big smile)
Hi, Donna.

NADINE
Hi, Donna.

DONNA
Hi.

Mike picks up his empty suitcase, he and Nadine stroll off towards the exit, arm in arm. Donna watches this curious exit, when Audrey appears in front of her.

AUDREY
Donna?

DONNA
(indicating a need for privacy)
Hi, can I talk to you for a second?

AUDREY
Sure.

They move away.

DONNA
I feel kind of funny asking you this.

AUDREY
What?

DONNA
Do you know any reason why my mom would be visiting
your dad?

AUDREY
Not off hand.

DONNA
He came to see her yesterday at the house. And today
she drove here to see him.

AUDREY
Maybe she's helping with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.

DONNA
If she was she'd have said something to me and she hasn't
said a word.

AUDREY
(a mischevious look)
Is she here now?

DONNA
I think they're in his office together. Why?

Eileen and Ben Horne are in the middle of a heated discussion. She's trying to give him a small packet.

BEN
- no, I won't accept them, they're yours, they were
written to you -

EILEEN
I don't want them. I won't have them in the house any
longer.

BEN
You've kept them twenty years, why now?

EILEEN
I'm asking you the same question: why now? All you'll
succeed in doing is ripping apart old wounds. I can't
bear the thought of it.

She's nearly overcome. He tries to comfort her.

BEN
Eileen, Eileen, why won't you believe me?

EILEEN
Words aren't good enough.

BEN
I want my actions to speak for me. Haven't you been
listening? I've been wrong all this time, I'm trying to
make up for it -

EILEEN
Sometimes making up for something only makes it
worse.

BEN
Have you told her?

EILEEN
God no. No and I never will. You must promise me the
same.
(pause, more pleading)
I'll never ask anything of you again.

BEN
All right. All right.

EILEEN
(handing the letters again)
Take them. Please.

Pause. He does.

EILEEN (CONTINUED)
You mustn't call. You mustn't come to the house again.

BEN
I understand.

EILEEN
I should hope you do. Goodbye, Ben.

BEN
Goodbye.

Eileen wheels herself towards the door. Ben moves to help her. They move out of sight.

TRUMAN

COLE
IF YOU WANT WE CAN ORDER SOME UP FOR
YOU.

Truman heads for the bathroom again. The others sit in a booth. Most of the diner is listening.

COLE
NOW THAT I COME TO MENTION IT, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M IN THE MOOD FOR? A
STEAK SO RARE YOU COULD SELL IT AT
TIFFANY'S.

COOPER
Gordon, you've come to the right place.

SHELLY JOHNSON appears behind the counter. Gordon spots her.

COLE
HOLY SMOKES, WHO IS THAT?

COOPER

Her name's Shelly Johnson.

COLE
WHAT A BEAUTY. REMINDS ME OF THAT
STATUE, THE BABE WITHOUT THE ARMS.

COOPER

THE POINT. THAT'S THE KIND OF GIRL
THAT MAKES YOU WISH YOU
KNEW A LITTLE FRENCH.
(slides out of the booth)
EXCUSE ME, WHILE I TRY MY HAND AT A
LITTLE COUNTER ESPERANTO.

Cole floats away. We follow him over to where Shelly continues to clean up the counter. Cole sits near her.

COLE
HELLO. I'M WONDERING IF I MIGHT
TROUBLE YOU FOR A CUP OF STRONG
BLACK COFFEE AND IN THE PROCESS
ENGAGE YOU WITH AN ANECDOTE OF NO
SMALL AMUSEMENT.

She smiles. Looks over at Cooper, who gives her an OK sign.

COLE
THE NAME'S GORDON COLE AND I
COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU FROM
THE BOOTH AND WELL, I SUDDENLY FEEL
LIKE I HAVE A BELLY FULL OF SPIROKEETS.

SHELLY
(patiently)
You don 't have to shout, sir, I can hear you perfectly
well.

COLE
I HEARD THAT.
(occurs to him that he did)
I HEARD THAT.

SHELLY
Would you like anything besides coffee?

COLE
(growing more agitated)
I HEARD YOU PERFECTLY.

SHELLY
And I can hear you. Honest. You don't have to shout.

COLE
(excited)
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -

She shusses him, amused.

COLE (CONTINUED)
- you don't understand, Miss Johnson, do you see these?

He points to his hearing aids.

SHELLY
Yes I do.

COLE
I've spent the last twenty years asking folks to speak up,
but for some weird reason I can hear you clear as a bell.
(takes out his hearing aids)
Say something else.

SHELLY
Would you like some pie with your coffee?

COLE
Good Lord, I can hear every word you say. This is
some kind of a miracle, a-a-a phenomenom.

The LOG LADY, who has been sitting at the counter, chimes in.

LOG LADY
My log thinks the cherry pie is a miracle as well.

COLE
(can't hear her)
WHAT'S THAT?

SHELLY
The cherry pie.

COLE
I heard you. I heard you again.

SHELLY
So would you like some pie?

COLE
Massive. Massive quantities. And a glass of water,
sweetheart, my socks are on fire.

COLE sits there with an absolute grin.

ANNIE BLACKBURNE moves to the booth to take their order. They're staring out the window. Annie does as well.

COOPER
(identifying)
Chickadee - sitting on a Dodge Dart.

TRUMAN
Think it's a finch - sitting on a Dodge Dart..

ANNIE
Nope. Chickadee. On a Dodge Dart.

Cooper turns back to see Annie smiling at him.

COOPER
Hi.

ANNIE
Hi. Coffee?

COOPER
For me.

TRUMAN
What's good for a hangover?

ANNIE
Teetotaling and prayer.

COOPER
(grins)
Good answer.

ANNIE
(good-humored)
Anyway, a cure might make you feel better and you're
supposed to suffer for your sins, remember?

TRUMAN
(lying)
That's a great comfort to me. I'll try coffee.

COOPER
How are you today?

ANNIE
I'm fine. Actually, I'm weird. I'm disoriented. I'm
not sure where I am exactly. I mean I know but it feels
odd, being here. I'm okay.

COOPER
(uncertain)
Good.

ANNIE
Gosh, listen to me, I've been out of circulation so long
I've completely forgotten about social niceties. I mean,
you ask me how I am, I'm not really supposed to say how
I am, I'm supposed to say, "I'm fine, thanks, how are you?"

Cooper smiles. He likes her a lot and he can't hide it.

ANNIE
You must think I'm really strange.

COOPER
Not at all.

ANNIE
But I mean, with due consideration to the social niceties,
even if I asked you and you did think I was strange, you
wouldn't say so, would you?

COOPER
If I thought you were strange, I would tell you.

ANNIE
And you don't. Think so.

COOPER
Not for a second.

Truman's been watching this like a ping-pong match.

ANNIE
Okay. Good. Glad we cleared that up. So. What'll
you have?

TRUMAN
Chicken pot pie. And a glass of milk.

ANNIE
Good choice. All the major food groups represented.

COOPER
Turkey sandwhich. Whole wheat. Lettuce. A hair of
mayonaise. And I've got a joke for you: a couple of
penguins are walking across an iceberg and the first one
says to the second, "You look like you're wearing a
tuxedo."

SHELLY'S VOICE
Annie?

COLE'S VOICE
I heard that.

ANNIE
Wait, I'll be right back.

COOPER
I wasn't quite finished.

Pause.

TRUMAN (his turn for prescience)
How long have you been in love with her?

COOPER
Who said anything about love?

TRUMAN
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.

Cooper is nailed. Maybe Truman's right. Not sure what to say. Annie comes back.

ANNIE
Okay, what did the second penguin say?

COOPER
(resuming with enthusiasm)
The first one says, "You look like you're wearing a
tuxedo." And the second one says, "Maybe I am."

TRUMAN
(after a millenium passes)
The defense rests.

ANNIE
That was cute.

COOPER
Thank you.

Pause. They look at each other. Annie realizes what she's doing, glances down at his napkin, where Cooper's been doodling.

ANNIE
What are you drawing?

Cooper looks down at his napkin.
CUT TO:


16. NAPKIN

He's doodling the tattos on the Log Lady and Major Briggs.

RESUME SCENE

COOPER
Oh. Nothing. A couple of tattoos.

ANNIE
(a longer look)
Funny. Looks like the rocks in Owl Cave.

She moves off. Cooper watches her go, a little moonstruck. Another look at the napkin, then Cooper snaps back on the beam.

COOPER
Owl Cave? What's Owl Cave?

TRUMAN
It's up near Pearl Lakes. Old Indian territory.
Supposed to be sacred ground. We used to go there
when we were kids.
(takes the napkin)
My God it does. It does look like it.

COOPER
(intuition pulsating)
Sounds like we better go there now.

They exchange a smile. Move in on the napkin.

17. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

Donna steps through the living room, leafing through a handful of afternoon mail. She stops suddenly, stares at a postcard, SAN FRANCISCO emblazoned across a rendering of the Golden Gate bridge. Donna turns the card over, reads. We HEAR:

JAMES' VOICE
Dear Donna. You were right. I had to go. Everything
feels different when you're on the road. It feels better.
San Francisco is really cool. Next stop, Mexico. I'll be
back with a million stories. Promise. I love you, James.

Donna looks up, tearful. DOC HAYWARD enters the room, sees the postcard in her hands.

HAYWARD
James? How is he?

DONNA
He's good. He's doing what he needed to do.

Hayward putters with at the table. Donna watches him for a beat.

DONNA
Dad? Can I ask you something?

HAYWARD
Sure.

DONNA
How does Mom know Ben Horne?

Hayward tries to hide the jolt her question brings. He looks into his daughter's eyes, and lies.

HAYWARD
I doubt that she does, Donna. Not very well.

DONNA
(knows he's lying)
But he was over here yesterday. They were talking like
old friends.

HAYWARD
(compounding the lie)
Your mother works with the local charities. I'm sure
even Ben contributes once in a while.

DONNA
She drove to the Great Northern this morning. And she
saw him again.

HAYWARD
Probably something to do with a fundraiser ...

DONNA
I don't think so.

HAYWARD
... yes, that's it. Eileen mentioned it to me at breakfast.
One of those Heal The Planet things.

DONNA
She never said anything about it to me.

HAYWARD
(very firm, end of discussion)
Well that's exactly what it is. Your mother told me so.

Donna pauses, uncertain. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.

DONNA
I'll get it.

Donna steps to the door, off-screen. Hayward watches his daughter with evident concern. When Donna returns, she holds a bouquet of flowers in her arms.

DONNA
They're for Mom. No card.

HOLD ON Donna for a beat. A blossom for every lie her father told her.

18. INT. TWIN PEAKS CITY LIBRARY - DAY

Audrey walks between dark library stacks, thinking about Wheeler, energized. She mounts a short ladder, inspects a row of dusty books. She removes one, leafs through it, eyes seeking pertinent information. Audrey begins to read, when ... SUDDENLY a footfall, Audrey looks up. A man stands close by in the shadows. Startled, Audrey nearly tips the ladder. But the quick-handed stranger grabs and steadies it.

STRANGER
Sorry. My fault.

AUDREY
It's okay. I didn't hear you coming...

STRANGER
One should never allow both mind and foot to wander at
the same time. Edward Perkins. Again, my apologies.

AUDREY
(pleased to meet a fellow seeker)
Audrey Horne. Pleased to meet you, Mister Perkins,

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals that she is shaking the hand of Windom Earle. He is dressed as a absent-minded academic. Trousers, shirt, cardigan sweater, wire-rim glasses. He eyes Audrey closely throughout, just short of rudeness, as if measuring her for some future use.

EARLE
What brings you to the library?

AUDREY
Research. On civil disobedience.

EARLE
Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey.

AUDREY
Are you a professor?

EARLE
I teach. Poetry is my area of expertise.

AUDREY
You're kidding. Someone sent me a poem. Wait.

She reaches into her jacket, pulls out the poem Windom sent to his three queens, now taped together. She holds it out for him to inspect. But Earle quietly demurs.

EARLE
You read it.

AUDREY
(after a beat)
See the montains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another,
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea...

EARLE (interjecting)
What is this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?

AUDREY
Yes ... you know it.

EARLE
Oh yes. Shelly.

Earle says it softly, wistful. He peers at Audrey with an intense expression. She wonders:

AUDREY
What ...?

EARLE
Gazing at you, perched on that ladder, reciting Shelly's
verse ... you look very much like a Queen.

AUDREY
(a little spooked)
Oh. Thanks. Well. I better go.
(descends, means to walk away)
Nice to meet you Mr. Perkins.

EARLE
(simply)
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.

Earle watches Audrey carry her book into the shadows.

19. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Cooper leads Andy and Hawk through the station. The deputies carry armloads of equipment - safety helmets, flashlights, pick-axes and rope. LUCY MORAN sits at her post, watches them pass. She sees Andy and sighs. He looks bold, dashing, ready for adventure.

LUCY
Andy?

Andy lingers. Cooper and Hawk continue to the Sheriff's office.

ANDY
Yes, Lucy?

LUCY
I want to thank you for helping out during the Weasel
Riot yesterday which is more than I can say for a certain
Dick we both know.

ANDY
(proud)
Keeping the peace is part of my job.

LUCY
Where are you going with all of that gear?

ANDY
Spelunking.

LUCY
Is it dangerous, spelunking?

ANDY
Sometimes.

LUCY
Promise me something?

ANDY
Okay.

LUCY
I know you'll be strong. And I know you'll be brave.
But I want you to promise me you'll be careful.

ANDY
(never more manly)
I'll be careful, Lucy. You have my word.

HOLD ON them for a beat. Love rekindled, or nearly so.
CUT TO:


20. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Truman peers down at the chess board as if to visualize the battle Cooper and Earle are fighting there. He reaches out to touch a piece when the door to his office OPENS. Truman, still suffering from a world class hangover, turns to face Cooper as he enters.

TRUMAN
Pete just called in our next move.

Truman hands a piece of paper to Cooper. Cooper reads it, steps to the board, moves the appropriate piece. He considers the resulting formation.

COOPER
We expose a pawn to his bishop.

TRUMAN
Want me to hold off?

COOPER
No. If he takes the pawn he'll forfeit the bishop and
most of his initial advantage. Feeling any better, Harry?

TRUMAN
Like someone pounded a railroad spike into my ear.

COOPER
Then a descent into a cool, subteranean cave may be just
what the doctor ordered.

Cooper tosses the helmet to Truman. He catches it cleanly.

22. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY

The diner is quiet, nearly empty. Annie cleans the counter, pauses to retrieve a flyer. It reads: THE MISS TWIN PEAKS PAGEANT, our Twentieth Anniversary. Shelly steps into view, reads it over Annie's shoulder.

SHELLY
Thinking of entering?

ANNIE
I think the real world's strange enough without getting up
on stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels'

SHELLY
Guess they're not too big on that kind of stuff in the
convent.

ANNIE
That's a good guess.

SHELLY
Is it strange, you know, being back in civilization?

ANNIE
(a little defensive)
It wasn't as if they kept us locked up in the attic. We
had newspapers. We even had cable TV. Every time I
tell someone where I've been they act like I'm out on
parole.

SHELLY
Sorry.

ANNIE
(pause, an admission)
You know what's weird? Being around men again.

SHELLY
You don't have to spend time in a convent to feel that.

ANNIE
(pause, trying to sound idle)
What do you know about Agent Cooper?

SHELLY
(gentle teasing)
Are you interested?

ANNIE
(in kind)
It's like anthropology. Examing the native flora and
fauna. For educational purposes

SHELLY
Uh-huh.

ANNIE
So. Tell me about him.

NORMA
Okay. He's a few years older than you. Handsome, but
not too handsome. He's really, really smart. He's in the
FBI. He loves Twin Peaks. He loves pie and coffee.
And trees.

ANNIE
(deadpan)
Good. Now I won't have to send to Washington for his
file.

SHELLY
And judging from the look on his face when he saw you
today, I'd say you have a major opporunity.

ANNIE
Who said anything about that?

Shelly walks away, with a knowing smile.

ANNIE (CONTINUED)
Sorry, you've got it wrong, I'm not even remotely
interested.

24. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

Ben paces, taking bites from a carrot. Audrey, sits upon the office sofa, looks on with an admiring smile.

BEN
Audrey, when Jack Kennedy entered the White House, he
took his brother with him, because he trusted Bobby to
tell him the truth even when it wasn't pretty. When the
Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there. When
the Russians moved missiles into Fidel's backyard,
Bobby helped his brother shoulder through.

AUDREY
Sort of like Jerry's been for you?

BEN
(moving closer)
The unvarnished truth is what I am looking for. I
believe you are the best man for the job.

AUDREY
(surprise and delight)
Me?

Ben kneels down before her, pauses. This is a new Ben. This comes straight from the heart.

BEN
Audrey, I haven't always been a good father to you. Oh,
hell, who am I kidding? When was I ever anything but a
sleazy rapacious heel?

AUDREY (moved)
Well. When I was little, maybe... I...

Audrey shrugs. Ben lived a life devoid of any and all goodness.

BEN
Exactly. But I've changed. And I'm determined to do
better. To be the kind of father you'll respect some day.
I think about Laura. I think about the mistakes I've
made...
(this is hard for him)
I want to build a life in happiness. For the whole
family. Together.
(beat)
Won't you help me? Please?

AUDREY (through her tears)
Daddy, I'm your man.

A warm beat. Ben rises, beaming.

BEN
Sensational. Audrey, pack a bag get out to the
airport. Your plane leaves in an hour.

AUDREY
(from tears to confusion)
My plane?

BEN
(looking off)
John! Just the man I want to see.

John Wheeler pauses in the open doorway, enters. Audrey turns to meet his gaze, remembers their plans for this evening. Her plane?!

AUDREY
Daddy, I...

WHEELER
Hello, Ben.

BEN
Audrey, you'd better get moving. One hour.
(to Wheeler)
Audrey's flying to Seattle tonight. She's having a
breakfast confab with the Sierra Club. We're going
national with this Pine Weasel thing.

AUDREY
I'm not sure I can leave on such short ...

BEN
(not listening, handing her a file)
Here are the particulars. Time, place, and so on. Bring
us back some good news.

AUDREY
(inspecting file, heart sinking)
Good news.

Audrey looks up. Her father beaming. Wheeler thinking about tonight. All the things they cannot say to Ben just yet. Or to each other.

AUDREY
(collecting her thoughts)
I'd better go.
(glances at Wheeler, a helpless shrug)
Goodbye.

WHEELER
(sotto voce)
Goodbye.

Ben, unaware, wraps his daughter in a big farewell hug.

BEN
Bless you, Audrey. Safe passage.

Audrey takes one last look at Wheeler and walks out the door. A beat. And Ben slumps down on the sofa with a mighty sigh.

WHEELER
What's wrong, Ben?

BEN
I am filled to the brim with goodness. Like a
Christmas tree all lit up inside me. But at the end of the
day, when I look in the mirror, I have to face the fact
that I don't really know how to be good.

WHEELER
(sitting down beside him)
You're off to a pretty fair start.

BEN
How do you do it, John? What's your secret? Can I learn
to be good too?

WHEELER
I don't see why not. Keep an eye on your heart. Always
tell the truth.

BEN
(the concept is wondrous)
Always tell the truth.

WHEELER
Tell the hardest truth first.

BEN
Terrific. Tell the hardest truth first. I love that. jack,
this truth business is clearly at the forefront of goodness.

WHEELER
Ben ...

BEN
Yes, jack?

WHEELER
I'm falling in love with your daughter.

BEN
Now there's a hard truth.

WHEELER
It is the truth.

BEN
It is?

WHEELER
Yes.

A long beat. Ben pats Wheeler on the knee. Father to son.

BEN
(with kindness and approval)
Ahh, Jack. What a wonderful world we live in.

HOLD ON Ben and Wheeler for a beat. Side by side upon the sofa. Ben offers Wheeler a carrot. Wheeler accepts.

25. EXT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT

Two police vehicles parked in the dark, their lights shining brightly upon the rock formations that enclose Owl Cave.
CUT TO:


26. INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT

START CLOSE on a pair of gloved hands desperately seeking purchase on a rocky wall. Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. Encouraging voices are HEARD:

TRUMAN, COOPER, HAWK
That's it, Andy. Careful. One hand at a time.

CAMERA PULLS back to reveal Andy's head pressed against the wall, grimacing with effort, and not a little afraid. He grunts, hand over hand, as Truman and the others shout instructions from below. Then, finally, with one last moan ... Andy sinks out of frame like a stone.

Andy lands with a thud on the floor of Owl Cave. Flashlight beams criss-cross his features as Cooper, Truman, and Hawk huddle about him

COOPER
Are you all right?

ANDY
(determined to be the man of action)
I'm fine.

They part, help Andy to his feet. And turn their lights on the interior of the cave. It is a large, airy space filled with rocky outcroppings, strange shapes in the dark.

COOPER
Incredible.

As the beams of light trip across the cave walls, Hawk intones:

HAWK
We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend it was
haunted by fierce ghosts.

Truman kicks something in the dark, picks it up. A beer can.

TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.

COOPER
(fascinated by every detail)
Where is the symbol?

HAWK
This way.

Hawk swings his flashlight beam across the cave, illuminates the far wall. And a ROCKY SHAPE upon it. Cooper and Truman aim their beams as well, step closer.

COOPER
Yes ...

The rocky symbol is a rough-hewn rendering of Cooper's drawing. An easily discernable shape extruding from the cave wall. It does not appear to be man-made.

COOPER
(to self)
Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for
what purpose?

TRUMAN
(the skeptic)
I don't know, Coop. It's similar, there's no denying that.

COOPER
It's more than similar, Harry. The tattoos are a
question. And this, somehow, is the answer.

Andy listens gravely, pick-axe over his shoulder, afraid. He flashes his light upon the symbol, forces himself a little closer. As if determined to contribute despite his fears.

COOPER
Why do they call it Owl Cave?

SUDDENLY: an owl's SHRIEK to wake the dead, the FLAPPING of enormous wings, something passes through the shadows overhead. Several things happen simultaneously:

Cooper, Hawk, and Truman whip their flashlights toward the passing sounds, but find nothing.

Andy yips, panics, and whirls about. His pick-axe STRIKING the cave symbol with a mighty blow. Rocks chip and tumble, a sort of whooshing rumble is heard ... and a small LANDSLIDE tumbles down upon his head.

TRUMAN
Andy!

All rush to his side, claw through the rocks and detritus. Andy lays beneath, bruised, stunned, but essentially unharmed.

ANDY
What was that?

COOPER
(he stands, preoccupied)
An owl.

ANDY
I'm sorry. I destroyed a national monument.

TRUMAN
Forget it, Andy. It's just a rock. The important thing -
(notices Cooper's expression)
Coop?

Cooper isn't listening. He's shining his light on the cave wall, the section revealed by the slide. His eyes are filled with wonder.

TRUMAN
What is it?

COOPER
I'm not sure.

Cooper steps forward, their beams join his to illuminate the wall. And there, partially obscured by the rock that remains, is a CAVE PAINTING of startling color and design.

TRUMAN
Good God.
(reaching out to touch it)
It appears to be a hieroglyph. We'll need the proper
tools to excavate. Harry, I have no idea where this will
lead us. But I have a feeling, a definite feeling, it will
be a place both wonderful and strange.

Cooper reaches out to touch the mysterious design. HOLD ON the cave painting for a beat. The rocky formation that once hid it from view.

28A. INT. CORRIDOR NEAR DINING ROOM

Cooper returns, speaking into his recorder.

COOPER
Diane. Wednesday night, late. Have just returned from from
a place called Owl Cave. How I got there is a long and
complicated story, but I will try to recount it
accurately. It all began with a pair of matching
tattoos...

Cooper stops, looks off. He sees someone familiar in the dining room/bar.
CUT TO:


29. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT

Annie Blackburne enters and sits alone at the bar, curious, uncertain. Will she ever be a part of this world? Annie raises an arm, tentative, to flag the bartender. Her actions are not those of someone timid or shy. But rather the first halting steps of a stranger new to a strange land.

ANNIE
Excuse me?
(off his look)
I'd like something to drink. I'm not exactly sure what.

BARTENDER
Ladies seem to like rum.

ANNIE
Rum. I'll have one, please. With...?

BARTENDER
Tonic.

The bartender steps off to fetch and pour. Annie turns her eyes back to the smokey room: couples seated at tables, talking, intimate and close. Annie watches with fascination and regret. A familiar VOICE penetrates her reverie. Agent Cooper.

COOPER
Hello, Annie.

ANNIE
Hi.

COOPER
Could I get you...

Annie notices the bartender has left her a cocktail.

ANNIE
No, thank you. I have rum and tonic.

COOPER
I see.

ANNIE
One of the Sister's put rum in her tea. I've never tasted it
before, but it sounds exotic. so I ...
(off his look)
I lived in a convent for five years. I might as well be
from Mars.

COOPER
You're doing fine. You're here, on your own. And you
have rum and tonic.

Cooper speaks with quiet humor and affection. Just the support Annie needs. She smiles appreciatively, lifts the glass to her lips, takes a drink. Reacts curiously. Not unpleasant.

Cooper watches her gazing at the room, the wonder and doubt in her eyes. Annie senses him watching her, Cooper wonders:

COOPER
It's all new to you. Everything.

ANNIE
I feel constantly amazed ... stunned. Music, people.
The way they laugh and talk. Some of them so clearly
in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just
enough of the words to realize how little I understand.

COOPER
I'd like to see the world through your eyes.

ANNIE
Why?

COOPER
There are things I would do differently if I had the
chance to start over again.

ANNIE
Me too.

Annie pauses, as if to consider a painful memory. She reaches for her glass of water, her sleeve slips up, reveals scars on her wrist. Cooper sees it, says nothing. But Annie knows he saw them.

ANNIE
The thing is, I've failed before. I'm afraid I might fail
again.

COOPER
Do you want to talk about it?

ANNIE
(simply, without rancor)
Not yet.

A beat. Cooper peers at Annie, feels something turn inside his heart. He falls in love.

COOPER
Can I help you, Annie?

ANNIE
Can you?

COOPER
Show you the world. Will you let me?

ANNIE
(after a beat)
I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.

COOPER
I can handle that.

ANNIE
Some people think I'm weird.

COOPER
I know the feeling.

ANNIE
I can't promise you I'd always make sense, or do the
things you expect me to.

COOPER
I don't expect anything.

ANNIE
(beat, then a big smile)
Then I accept your kind and generous offer.

Cooper smiles in kind, reaches out to touch Annie's hand and hold it, just below the scars. He's wanted to touch her from the first moment they met.

30. INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT

SUDDENLY - CAMERA follows a flashlight beam as it pierces the darkness inside Owl Cave. The beam splashes light upon the cave's rocky walls, then, finally, holds on the landslide aftermath, the symbol's fragment, the cave painting revealed beneath.

A beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals the man holding onto the flashlight, now staring intently at the cave painting. It is Windom Earle.

EARLE

My, my, my. What have we here?

FADE IN:

1. INT. OWL CAVE - DAY

OPEN ON the interior of Owl Cave, dark and silent. Suddenly: VOICES coming closer.

COOPER, TRUMAN, etc.
This way... careful Andy...

Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. AGENT COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK and DEPUTY ANDY enter. Cooper and Truman carry flashlights, backpacks filled with excavation equipment. Hawk holds a bright lantern. Andy is armed with sketch pad, pencils. All pause, turn toward the cave symbol. Cooper reacts with a curse.

COOPER
Dammit.

The painting has been tampered with, ten dowels, with obscure symbols attached, now extend from it, seemingly abstract, without obvious intent or meaning.

TRUMAN
But who...?

Hawk kneels at the base of the painting, casts lantern light upon the cave floor. He's examining fresh tracks left in the dirt. Cooper steps toward him.

HAWK
I saw the same tracks outside the power station. Weight
shift to the left foot. A break in the heel.

COOPER
Windom Earle.

TRUMAN
What would Earle be doing here?

COOPER
That's a frightening question to contemplate.
(turns to face the others)
Andy. I need an accurate, large scale rendering of this
painting. Harry, we need to speak to Major Briggs
immediately.

TRUMAN
(mystified, but supportive)
Whatever you say, Coop. I'll call from the jeep.

Cooper nods assent. Truman exits. Hawk steps to Andy, casts additional light upon the painting as the deputy draws and copies. Copper pivots, gazes at the mysterious image. As if to wonder where it might lead him.
CUT TO:


2. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

START CLOSE on WINDOM EARLE. Seated in an armchair, pipe in hand, avuncular in aspect, he begins:

EARLE
Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the White Lodge. Fawns gamboled there amidst
happy laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and
laughter filled the air. When it rained it rained sweet
nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
one's life in truth and beauty.
(beat)
Generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's
sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of
kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young
and old compelled to do good without reason. But, I
am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place
of saccharine excess.

As he speaks, CAMERA PANS from Earle, travels toward his unseen audience, revealing LEO JOHNSON seated cross-legged on the floor, as if listening to a bedtime story.

EARLE
For there is another place, its opposite, of almost
unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
vicious secrets. No prayers dare penetrate this frightful
maw. Spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
invocations. They are as like to rip the muscle from
our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. And, if
harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
(beat)
This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge. And
I intend to find it.

CAMERA CONTINUES to PAN, reveals a dull-witted YOUTH seated at Leo's school desk. Long stringy hair, head band, a vacant stare. Some sullen refugee from a speed metal talent show.

YOUTH
Listen, man. The story's cool. But you promised me
beer. Besides, you told me there was gonna be a party up
here. Black Lodge, White Lodge, like what's the big
deal?

CAMERA CONCLUDES its move, HOLDS ON Earle's computer screen, where we see a computer rendering of the hieroglyph from Owl Cave.

EARLE
In time, young man. Everything in time.

PETE MARTELL sits at his chess board, peering silently at the pieces, morose, mournful.

PETE
(nearly whispered)
I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie...

When she walked into the flowers stood up

Room... doom... fume... gloom...

I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie, when she
walked into the room, the flowers were all abloom...

Oh Josie...

Pete's poetic reverie is interrupted when CATHERINE MARTELL storms into the room. She's carrying the mysterious black box Eckhardt gave her.

CATHERINE
Pete! Stop your incessant moping and give me a hand
with this damn box.

PETE
What exactly do you want me to do?

CATHERINE
Open it. I've been trying all morning. Thomas
Eckhardt left this box to me when he died. I want it
opened and I want it opened now.

PETE
(taking box into his hands)
Well ... let's take a look-see... do you have a key?

CATHERINE
If I had a key, it would be be open already, don't you
think?

PETE
'Course there's no key hole...
(he plays with the sides and edges of the box,
pieces that interact as if part of a larger puzzle)
It's a puzzle box. Saw one of these at a crafts emporium
in Guam. I was taking a little R and R with the
Doolittle twins, there was this monkey show that you
wouldn't believe, and Dale Doolittle, he was the larger
of the two, come to think of it, for twins they didn't
look at all alike...

CATHERINE
PETE!!!

PETE
Sorry, Poodle.
(returns to the box, the slats and sections)
The trick is to fit the pieces together just so...

CATHERINE
(with renewed hope)
Yes. And how long is that going to take?

Pete concentrates on the puzzle box, brow furrowed, lips pursed. A long beat.

PETE
This could take years.

BOBBY BRIGGS and SHELLY JOHNSON sit in a booth. Shelly is in uniform, she's got tables to attend to - but Bobby insists:

BOBBY
Shel, I've been thinking about the future, about what it
takes to get ahead in this world. I'm reading up,
watching TV: suddenly it comes to me. Boom. The
secret to success.
(leaning closer, dead serious)
Beautiful people get everything they want.

SHELLY
Oh, Bobby...

BOBBY
Think about it. When's the last time a pretty blonde
went to the electric chair? You arc very beautiful, Shelly,
and I think it's time we took advantage of the Beautiful
People's Conspiracy.

SHELLY
(sardonic)
Know any senators I can marry?

BOBBY
(pulling pamphlet from his jacket)
Check it out. Miss Twin Peaks. Once we get that crown
on your head, the sky's the limit.

SHELLY
(a little weary of pipedreams)
Dream on, Bobby. I got tables to wait on...

BOBBY
(curt)
Don't argue. Bobby's in charge, understand? You gotta
enlist by this afternoon.

It's an order, not a request. Bobby holds out the brochure. Shelly pauses, wounded by his attitude. He doesn't care what she thinks. But Shelly takes the brochure nonetheless.

7. ANOTHER BOOTH

MAYOR MILFORD and LANA BUDDING-MILFORD share a booth nearby.

LANA
There's something I want you to do for me. Darling.

MILFORD
I'll do anything mind and body can stand. Surely the
last few days have been proof of that. You just name it.

LANA
(carefully considered)
I want to win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

MILFORD
You just name it.

LANA
I want to win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

MILFORD
Of course. I've given a speech or two in my time. I'll.
coach you day and night.
Dear, that's not what I'm thinking about. You're one of
the judges.
(to the point one more time)
You can guarantee it.

MILFORD
(after a long beat)
But... but... but... but... it would be wrong.

LANA
(reaching out to caress)
Oh, darling. It would be love. That's all.

Mayor Milford grumbles, looks about, then back into the eyes of the woman he loves.

MILFORD
I'll do anything for you, Lana. You know that.

LANA
Yes, lover. I do.

8. AT THE COUNTER

ANNIE BLACKBURNE carries a pot of coffee, offers a refill or two. She reaches the cash register ... and finds Cooper waiting for her. Annie brightens like the sun.

ANNIE
Hi.

COOPER
Morning, Annie.

ANNIE
Breakfast?

COOPER
Sorry. I've got a police cruiser full of hungry lawmen
waiting in the parking lot. A box of donuts, to go. And
a cup of hot coffee for the road.

ANNIE
Coming right up.

Annie turns to retrieve, a little disappointed. Cooper watches her calls out.

COOPER
And Annie...?
(off her look, unusually awkward)
I was wondering if you were available later for a little
nature study. Together.

ANNIE
Nature study? Sure.

COOPER
(realizing)
How strange.

ANNIE
What?

COOPER
When I speak to you I get am odd tingling sensation in
my stomach and toes.

ANNIE
Interesting. I'll get those donuts.

Annie steps away. Shelly rings up a sale on the cash register, frowns as Bobby steps to the door without a goodbye. Then, at last, he turns to face her.

BOBBY
You're beautiful, Shelly. Got it? So take advantage.

Bobby makes her feel like it's a curse. Bobby exits. Shelly sighs, quotes:

SHELLY
What is all this sweet work worth, if thou kiss not me?

Shelly turns to see Cooper staring at her. He looks as though he's seen a ghost.

COOPER
What did you say?

SHELLY
Someone sent me a poem. It was anonymous.

COOPER
I need to see that poem immediatley, Shelly. Please.

SHELLY
Sure.

Shelly reaches under the counter, retrieves her purse. She hands her third of the poem to Cooper. He inspects it.

SHELLY
We each got a piece. Donna, Audrey, and me.

COOPER
I'll have to take this with me.

Shelly nods assent. Annie returns bearing donuts and coffee.

ANNIE
One dozen to go. Cup of coffee.

COOPER
Thank you very much.

Cooper pays in a hurry, turns for the door without another word.

ANNIE
Agent Cooper...?
(off his look)
This afternoon...?

COOPER
I'll meet you here. Four o'clock sharp.

With that, he vanishes, clutching Shelly's poem along with the donuts and joe. HOLD ON Shelly and Annie. They exchange a look, wonder what's on his mind.

FADE TO BLACK.

9. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

OPEN ON Deputy Andy in the station conference room. He stands at the blackboard, painstakingly reproduces the cave painting upon it. Andy erases, alters, draws primitive lines on the slate.
CUT TO:


10. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE

Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman confer in the latter's office. Truman examines the poem fragment Shelly gave to Cooper.

TRUMAN
Mountains kiss... waves clasp... what's this all about,
Coop?

COOPER
It's part of a poem, torn into thirds. Sent to Shelly
Johnson, Audrey Horne, and Donna Hayward... by
Windom Earle.

TRUMAN
Earle's contacted all three? Are you sure?

COOPER
(quoting the poem from memory)
See the mountains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother...
(beat)
I sent this same poem to Caroline once.

TRUMAN
I don't like the sound of this.

COOPER
It may be nothing more than a taunt. Earle takes a sick
pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.

TRUMAN
And if it's not?

COOPER
Let's talk to the girls as soon as possible. See what they
recall.

Deputy Hawk enters.

HAWK
Major Briggs is here. Conference room.
(offering manila envelope)
Donna Hayward's poem. Audrey Horne is in Seattle
until tomorrow.

Cooper opens the envelope, removes another fragment, aligns it with the first on Truman's desk. He peers at the poem for a beat, preoccupied, an idea forming. Hawk turns to exit.

COOPER
Hawk?
(off his look)
Bring me Leo Johnson's arrest report. Anything that
might have his handwriting on it.

Hawk, nods, exits. Truman wonders:

TRUMAN
What's the connection?

COOPER
(staring at poem fragments)
There isn't one. Yet.
CUT TO:


11. CONFERENCE ROOM

Major Briggs watches Deputy Andy transcribe the cave painting with fascination. As Andy connects two figures, the Major suddenly interrupts:

BRIGGS
Deputy Brennan? As I remember, the line you are
drawing should proceed downward, not across.

Andy checks the original rendering on his sketch pad. Andy erases, redraws. Then it hits him. He turns to Major Briggs, mystified.

ANDY
How did you know that?

Cooper and Truman enter.

COOPER
Major Briggs. We need your help. Yet I find it
difficult to accurately describe why or how.

BRIGGS
(on the same wave length)
Go on.

COOPER
The Twin Peaks Sheriffs department is currently
involved in several disparate investigations. The
disappearance of a known felon, Leo Johnson. The
appearance of my former partner, a murderer, Windom
Earle. And the discovery of an ancient hieroglyph in a
place called Owl Cave.
(beat)
Logic demands that these investigations remain separate
entities. But recent developments suggest otherwise. I
believe that these mysteries are not separate entities, but
are in fact complimentary verses of the same song. I
cannot hear the song yet, Major Briggs. But I can feel it.
And that is enough for me to proceed.

BRIGGS
As a military man, I am familiar with damage done by
blind adherence to logic. How exactly may I help you?

COOPER
I need to know everything there is to know about
Windom Earle's work with Project Blue Book.

BRIGGS
That would involve accessing classified Air Force
computer files.

COOPER
Yes, it would.

BRIGGS
My security clearance was revoked shortly after my
disappearance.

COOPER
And your ability to access the Blue Book files?

BRIGGS
The issue is not one of access. There are, however,
certain moral judgements I must consider.

COOPER
Of course.

BRIGGS
Will this information help you to prevent future loss of
life?

COOPER
Yes.

BRIGGS
Can you gain this intelligence without my intervention?

COOPER
No.

Pause. Briggs rises, steps to the blackboard. Andy's rendering of the cave painting upon it.

BRIGGS
Is this a copy of the hieroglyph you found in Owl Cave?

COOPER
(joining Briggs)
Yes. Do you know it?

BRIGGS
I have dreamed it. Or seen it. Somewhere. Somehow.

Briggs stares at the hieroglyph for a long beat. Then turns to face Cooper and the rest.

BRIGGS
I will do what you ask.

Deputy Hawk enters with a file, hands it to Cooper.

HAWK
Leo Johnson's arrest report.

Cooper takes the file, opens it. He finds examples of Johnson's handwriting. As the others look on, Cooper arrays the sample next to the poem fragments. As he works:

COOPER
The damage Leo suffered would no doubt alter certain
handwriting characteristics. But his basic style remains
the same...
(putting the pieces together, turning to the others)
This poem, sent by Windom Earle, was transcribed by
Leo Johnson.

TRUMAN
Leo's working for Earle?

COOPER
(looking back at poem)
Yes. Or is his captive.

HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. Cooper, Truman, Hawk, Andy, and Major Briggs. The evidence before them. Verses to the same song.

12. INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

START CLOSE on DICK TREMAYNE carefully adjusting an unwieldy nose bandage. Tremayne frowns, sniffs. Then spots someone OFF-SCREEN.

TREMAYNE
(a rather nasal quality)
Mr. Horne!!

Tremayne hurries to intercept BEN HORNE as he passes through the dining room.

BEN
Yes?

TREMAYNE
Mr. Horne as you are no doubt aware there are but scant
hours until our wine tasting benefit begins and I cannot
find your daughter anywhere.

BEN
Audrey is spending the day in Seattle. However, I'm
sure our concierge will be happy to assist.

TREMAYNE
The concierge. Yes, capital. Thank you Mr. Horne.

Tremayne rushes on. But Horne calls after.

BEN
(doesn't know his name)
Excuse me. You there.

TREMAYNE
(turning to face him)
Richard Tremayne, sir. Men's fashions.

BEN
Of course. Tell me, how is your nose?

TREMAYNE
Oh, Mr. Horne. Think nothing of it. A nose is a small
price to pay in the service of a greater good.

BEN
We'll of course take care of your medical expenses.

TREMAYNE
(sycophant and conniver both)
How kind. One might also think worker's compensation
of some variety will be involved...

BEN
Easily done.

TREMAYNE
Capital, Mr. Horne. I'll alert my attorney.

Tremayne scurries off. Horne frowns, sighs.

BEN
(to self)
Sometimes the urge to do bad is nearly overpowering.
(mimicking nasal Trumayne)
I'll alert my attorney.

Ben sighs, extracts a carrot from his pocket. Stalks away.

CUT TO:


Windom Earle opens a beer, hands it to Leo, speaks to the heavy metal youth, OFF-SCREEN.

EARLE
Drink up, friend. We celebrate.

Leo carries the beer to the youth, now revealed INSIDE a huge papier mache CHESS PIECE.

YOUTH
Celebrate? I can barely move my arms.

Leo carefully puts the can to the youth's lips, offers a hearty swallow. Earle places the last few pieces upon the wire frame, effectively encasing the heavy metal youth inside.

EARLE
You have lived your short life in odium and obscurity.
But now, at the end, you will step upon the larger stage.
I must confess, I envy you. Your journey begins at a point
beyond imagining. Who knows where you might travel
from there?

YOUTH
I'm pumped. Is this for the Lilac Parade or what?

EARLE
Not a parade, my friend. Not exactly.

YOUTH
Well I'm real cool about helpin' out and everything. But
how do I get out of this thing?

EARLE
(simply)
You don't.

Earle reaches into a chest, produces a wooden bow. He turns to Leo, orders.

EARLE
Leo. Fetch me an arrow.

Leo pauses - he's been feeding beer to the youth all along - turns to regard him.

YOUTH
Arrow. Whoa, man. I do not appreciate practical jokes.

EARLE
Leo. The arrow.

Leo sets the can of beer upon a table, faces Earle. And does not move. He manages:

LEO
N.... no.

Earle doesn't hesitate. He grabs the shock collar remote, presses the appropriate button. Leo shivers and falls, struck down by its power.

YOUTH
Jeez, don't zap the geek. How'm I supposed to get my
beer without...

Earle zaps Leo a second time, lifting him clear of the floor. Leo moans, crawls to his knees.

YOUTH
Oh, dude ... that's gotta hurt...

EARLE
Fetch me... an arrow.

Leo staggers, stands. And walks to a basket near his makeshift bed. He retrieves an arrow - whittled to perfection, armed with a wicked steel point - and brings it back to Earle.

LEO
(wounded and fearful)
Arrow...

EARLE
Thank you, Leo.

Earle turns back to the papier mache chess piece, the youth trapped inside.

YOUTH
What's with the arrow, man... what are you doing?! This
isn't funny, man. This is not funny.

EARLE
Please. Be still.

YOUTH
What the hell are you doing...?!?

EARLE
(loading arrow as the youth continues to plead)
Think of all the hapless sinners, wondering where their
soul's destination lies? Think of the prayers and the
doubt, the gut-sucking fear that visits late at night. And
for what? To gain the answer to a simple question.
Where will my spirit wake? What life am I given after
my life? This grave question has plagued man's sorry
conscience for eons. And you, lucky boy, have the
answer... now.

Earle UNLEASHES the arrow, it tears through the air, pierces the heart of the papier mache chess piece... and the heart of the heavy metal youth inside.

ANGLE ON CHESS PIECE

The arrow buried up to the hilt. A small trickle of blood seeping from the hole it makes.

ANGLE ON LEO

Watching the later with undisguised shock and horror. Wakened from one nightmare to
another.

DOC
The "Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules" committee is
hereby in session.

MILFORD
This is going to be a very exciting year. A very exciting
year. A very exciting year.

DOC
Thank you, Dwayne. First order of business; Ben Horne
has asked to address the committee as a Friend of the
Committee.

MILFORD
I don't have any objection to that.

PETE
Address away, Ben.

BEN
Thank you. And Dwayne, may I congratulate you on
your recent engagement.

MILFORD
Think you very much.

BEN
She's a lovely girl and I wish you much happiness.

MILFORD
Thank you very much.

BEN
Gentlemen. My purpose is simple. The age of the
ogling, swimsuited jiggle festivals of the past is dead.
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe rightly, is now a celebration
of the totality of a woman's qualities. Beauty has taken
on a broader definition that includes mind, values, ideas
and for taking that step, gentlemen, I applaud you.

MILFORD
What's he selling? What are you selling?

BEN
Let me get night to the point. The centerpiece of your
voting procedure is the Contestants Address to the
Town. Miss Twin Peaks is an event in search of a theme.
What I propose is simple: the to pic of this year's
speeches should be; How to Save Our Forests.
(pause, for effect)
It's now, it's relevant, it's global, it's, to put it plainly,
gentlemen ... us.

Pause. The committe members look at each other.

PETE
'Course your opposition to the Ghostwood development
plans wouldn't have anything to do with this.

BEN
Pete, I have to say I resent your implication. The
environmental issues here clearly dwarf any parochial
business concern that I or you or anyone else might be
pursuing.

DOC
We'll take it under advisement.

MILFORD
We'll take it under advisement.

BEN
The best I could hope for. Thank you, gentlemen, for
your time.

Ben rises and briskly exits.

PETE
Thinks he can pull a fast one.

MILFORD
The idea has merit. The idea has merit.

DOC
I'm in favor of it, myself

MILFORD
As am I. Good topic. Lively material.

PETE
Okay, okay. Let's start processing the candidates, I
gotta get back to the chess board.

Hey, Chief.

BEN
Bobby. Wine tasting party, eight o'clock.

Donna watches Ben carefully. Ben nods to her, exits. Pete announces to the waiting group.

PETE
Would the first candidate please approach the
committe.

MILFORD
(cutting through the red tape)
Lana? Come on up honey.

Lana sashays up to the stage, sits in font of the committee.

BOBBY
I smell a fix.

SHELLY
I don't know if I can do this, Bobby. I've never given a
s speech in my life. I had to give a book report in Mrs.
Gardner's class in fourth grade and I passed out right in
front of the whole room.

BOBBY
You'll be great, doll. I'm gonna be your speechwriter.

DONNA
It's not as hard as you think, Shelly.

SHELLY
I could sure use that scholarship money.

MIKE NELSON and NADINE enter. Nadine moves to Donna.

NADINE
Donna, are you entering too?

DONNA
Uh, yeah. You too, huh?

NADINE
Wouldn't miss it for the world. Isn't it exciting?

DONNA
Uh, yeah.

Bobby gestures to Mike, takes him aside.

BOBBY

Hey, long time no see.

BOBBY
I'd ask where you been keeping yourself but I think I

This is very scary, Mike.

MIKE
It's not what you think.

BOBBY
It's not what I think? What do you think I think?

MIKE
You think I'm going out with an older woman.

BOBBY
I think I don't know where you got this sudden interest
in the life of fossils.

MIKE
(a knowing smile)
Yeah, I know. It's not what you think.

BOBBY
Mike. Big favor. Clear this up for me.

MIKE
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

BOBBY
I will strive to be understanding.

MIKE
(decides to confide)
Do you have any idea what a combination of sexual
maturity and superhuman strength can result in?

Bobby looks at him, a glimmer of comprehension forming. Mike whispers something more elaboarte and descriptive in his ear.

BOBBY

Everyone in the room turns to look at him.

BOBBY (CONTINUED)
Sorry.

Nadine winks at Mike. Mike winks back. Bobby understands.

19. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE STUDY - DAY

Harry Truman sits with Catherine.

TRUMAN
(sincerely)
If there's anything you can tell me about her at all.
Anything to help me understand.

CATHERINE
For instance.

TRUMAN
What did she want? Why did she do the things she did?

CATHERINE
I'm asking myself a lot of the same questions.

TRUMAN
I want to know. I want to believe she wasn't all bad.
There was something good there. Decent.

CATHERINE
(pasue, honestly)
I think early in her life she must have learned the lesson
that she could survive by being what other people wanted
to see. Showing them that. It was probably something
she had no choice about. And I think that eventually
became the largest truth in her life. In time even she no
longer knew who she truly was. She, I don't know quite
how to say this ... she lost her ... center. What was left of
her private self she may never have shown anyone.

TRUMAN
So the lies, all the stories ...

CATHERINE
Who knows? They may not have seemed untrue to her.
What she needed to believe was always shifting to suit
the moment. A ball of knots. Knotted, tangled string.
In spite of everything she tried to do to me and my
family I find it's curiously hard to hate her for it.

TRUMAN
(almost privately)
... she was so beautiful.

Catherine looks at him.

CATHERINE
Maybe there's some clue we can both benefit from.

TRUMAN
What's that?

Catherine removes the box from her desk.

CATHERINE
Thomas Eckhardt left this for me when he died. It
occured to me it might have something to do with her.

TRUMAN
What's inside?

CATHERINE
I don't know. I haven't been able to open it.

TRUMAN
Let me see.

Truman takes the box. Runs his hands over the intricate filligree work.

TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
There's no handle or lid.
(CONTINUED)

Sound of a door opening. Pete enters, under a head of enthusiastic steam.

PETE
Wowee Bob, we got some beauties in the contest this
year, hello, Harry, seems like every gal in town's lining
up to take a shot at the - say, any luck with this thing?

Pete takes the box from Harry.

CATHERINE
(with a sigh)
Not yet.

Pete drops the box on the floor.

PETE
(kneeling to retrieve it)
Whoops.

CATHERINE
Butterfingers...

Pete's not listening. He's staring at the mysterious box. A seamless top lid is slowly,
automatically sliding open.

PETE
Holy moley ...

CATHERINE
What is it?

Pete looks inside, pulls out a small version of the larger box. This one has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface.

CATHERINE
Give it to me.

PETE
(an idea forms)
Just a sec, Poodle...

Pete carefully drops the second box, as if certain it will open if dropped like the first. No such luck. Undaunted, Pete retrieves it, means to drop the box again.

CATHERINE
Pete...

PETE
(deeply focused)
I held it just so, and then I...

Catherine growls, grabs the box from Pete's hands. All peer at the mysterious gift, wonder what they might find inside.

ANNIE
I used to swim out here when I was a kid. Every
summer. Two, three times a week.

COOPER
I can understand why. It's beautiful.

ANNIE
I guess even then I felt a closer connection nature than
I did to people. I was kind of a weird kid.

COOPER
Really? How?

ANNIE
That's what people used to say. Never had many
friends. Norma was Miss Popularity. Seemed like she
was always moving towards the world. I was always
moving away from it. I lived in my head, mostly.

COOPER
Not a bad neighborhood.

ANNIE
(quietly self-deprecating)
Well there were some pretty strange neighbors.

COOPER
(another topic)
Boyfriends?

ANNIE
No. No. I ... well, I had one.

COOPER
High school?

ANNIE
Senior year.

COOPER
Anything to do with your going into the convent?

ANNIE
I'm sorry, do you mind if we don't talk about it?

COOPER
We can talk about whatever you like.

ANNIE
(slowly, trying to be resolute)
I want to come back to the world. I was so frightened
for so long. Of everything. Of life. I thought I'd be
safe there. Everybody here thought I was nuts. And when
I think about it, it was such a weird nineteenth century
thing to do. To think I could remove myself, as if that
could stop the noise in my head, when the problem
was me, it was always in ... me ...

COOPER
(softly, looking at her)
I understand.

ANNIE
Silence. Prayer. It wasn't the religion. It could have
been a Buddhist retreat. Walden Pond. A quiet room.
(she turns to him)
But you sit in a room like that long enough and you
realize, I realized that I was just hiding and that running
away from my fear didn't make the fear go away ...

COOPER
It made it stronger.

ANNIE
(a tear in her eye)
Yes. So I had to face it. I had to face myself. And I
have to do it here. Where everything went so wrong.

Cooper takes her hand. She lets him hold it. He touches the scars on her wrists. She doesn't withdraw the hand. Looks at him.

COOPER
(his way of asking why)
I know how hopeless things can seem. I know the kind of
dark tunnel you can fall into.

ANNIE
(decides to tell him this much)
It happened before I went away. It happened because of
that boy. I went away because of it. That's all you need
to know.

COOPER
(nods, pauses)
Annie, I ... I had a similar experience. Not the same.
Similar. I'd like to ... help you ... in any way I can ...

She kisses him. They speak very quietly.

ANNIE
I don't know you very well.

COOPER
No.

ANNIE
I'm trying to learn how to trust my instincts.

COOPER
What are they telling you?

ANNIE
Trust.

There's no hurry.

I think maybe there is.

How so?

SHE'S A RARE AND PRECIOUS INDIVIDUAL
DON'T YOU THINK?

COOPER
Yes, Gordon. She is.

COLE
Shelly, turn and face me before I lose my nerve.

Shelly looks up from her pie, faces him.

COLE
I'm about to leave Twin Peaks. I don't know when I'll
return. But I want you to know that meeting you has been
more than a privilege. It has touched my heart and soul.
And I know that if I don't kiss you now I will regret it
the rest of my days.

There's something sweet and kind in this dizzy oration. When Gordon leans close to kiss her, Shelly receives him without hesitation. Cooper looks on with a smile: The whole world is in love. just then: Bobby Briggs enters, stops and stares.

BOBBY
What the hell is going on here...?

Cole breaks from the kiss, regards the angry youth, grins.

It's a fine tradition. I've worked with the pageant for
years.

DONNA
I entered.

EILEEN
Really? But you never...

DONNA
Why not? I could use the scholarship money to study
overseas.

She means away from here. Eileen and Doc exchange a look. Donna simmers between.

26. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR AREA - NIGHT

Still wearing the cumbersome nose bandage, Dick Tremayne taps a wine glass with a knife, calling the wine tasting party to order. A dozen or so people sit in the bar area, including Ben Horne, Andy, Lucy, Lana Budding and a few of the models from the fashion show. Everyone has two wine glasses in front of them and a spit bucket. On the table in front of Dick are a number of wine bottles, covered in bags.

TREMAYNE
Good evening. Evening all. Welcome to our
oenophiliac soiree, another in a continuing series of
public events, sponsored by Horne Industries, to benefit
the Stop Ghostwood Development movement.

ANDY
(sotto)
Ono-what?

LUCY
(sotto)
Something to do with wine.

TREMAYNE
When my good friend, Ben Horne, asked me how would
I like to contribute to the Good Fight, I said to myself,
Dick, I said, you're a former sommelier why not try to
bring a little culture to the proceedings? I replied ... but
of course: a wine-tasting parry. Uplift the general level
of quality of life at the same time we're putting money
into the fight to save our trees. Voila!
(small, polite, smattering of applause)
I should of course mention that our wines this evening are
all courtesy of the Great Northern's wine cellar, thank
you, Ben, and now ... to the tasting! Lana, Lucy, if you'd
help me pour, please.

Lana and Lucy jump up to help him pour out the contents of the first tasting. Dick flirts rather obviously with Lana, which Lucy can't fail to notice. She simmers as she pours.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
(as they pour)
Our first wines tonight are reds. There are some schools
of thought who of course say there are no other wines but
reds.

Andy raises his hand.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Yes, Andy.

ANDY
(he's been studying)
There are also white wines and sparkling wines.

TREMAYNE
(long-suffering)
Thank you, Andy.
(watching his charges; warmly)
Very good, Lana.
(not as warmly)
Don't pour quite so much, Lucy.

Another cold look from Lucy to Lana and Dick.

TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Now that we're all poured, let's first examine -
(to Andy, who's drinking)
Don't taste it, yet, Andy, for heaven's sake.

Andy has a mouthful of wine.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Spit it out.

Andy spits into the bucket.

ANDY
Sorry.

TREMAYNE
That's all right. That's what we're here for: to learn.
Now, to the wine. First we must examine the nose of the
wine, to see what it can tell about its bouquet. And
we do that by ...

LANA
(the prize pupil)
By smelling.

TREMAYNE
Very good, Lana.

Another look from Lucy.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Lift the glass thusly ...
(lifting it to his nose, now talking into the glass)
And while vigorously rolling the wine around in the
glass, we breathe deeply and fully.

Unbeknownst to him, the wine seeps into the gauze bandage on Tremayne's nose and a crimson blotch starts to creep cellularly upwards.

TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
That's good. Now, procedurally, we take our first
taste, a big, boisterous gulp and roll it energetically
around our entire palate, trying to involve those hard to
reach taste buds, tucked away in the back of our tongues.
Remembering not to swallow ...

The class takes a sip and rolls it around in their mouths.

TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Excellent. And now ... we ... spit.

As one, the group spits noisily into their buckets.

27. INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT

By the fireplace in the other room, Jack Wheeler enters and sits near a pensive Dale Cooper, nursing a drink, staring into the fire. A beat. Wheeler emits a rueful sigh, thinking of Audrey. A beat. Cooper allows a happy little whistle of satisfaction. He's thinking about Annie. A beat. Wheeler sighs again. Cooper whistles. Both gradually aware of the other. Then, at last, more to himself:

WHEELER
Love is hell.

COOPER
Sorry?

WHEELER
Love. It's hell.

COOPER
The Hindus say love is the ladder to heaven.

WHEELER
We're both right.

COOPER
"Proof of heaven, while we're living."

WHEELER
The Hindus have also been known to take a hike on hot
coals for recreational purposes.

COOPER
(a mild correction)
Self-discipline.

WHEELER
Self- discipline and love are a bad match.

COOPER
(agreeing; what he's facing)
Earthly love.

WHEELER
What other kind is there?

COOPER
When you're in it, none.

WHEELER
It hits you like an eighteen-wheeler. And there's no
relief.

COOPER
It makes you feel more alive.

WHEELER
And you feel more of everything. Pain included.

COOPER
Pain especially.

WHEELER
Can't think of anything but her.

COOPER
No.

WHEELER
She goes away, it's like a part of you's ripped out of its
socket.

COOPER
(a look at him)
Sounds like you've got a pretty serious case.

WHEELER
I am roped, tied and branded.

COOPER
She feel the same way?

WHEELER
(lifts his drink)
Here's hoping.

Cooper lifts his drink in support.

WHEELER
How 'bout you? You on the critical list, too?

COOPER
(considers, then)
I feel like someone's taken a crowbar to my heart.

WHEELER
That's not bad.

COOPER
No. I think maybe it's been locked away long enough.

WHEELER
Then that's good.

COOPER
(lifts his drink)
Here's hoping.

WHEELER
Here's to you.

They drink. A beat. A VOICE interrupts:

VOICE
Mr. Wheeler, telegram for you, sir.

A BELLMAN holds out a telegram. Wheeler takes it, tips him. He opens the telegram. We SEE it's from Brazil. Grim news.

WHEELER
Damn.
(to Bellman as he exits)
Bellman?

The Bellman stops, turns to regard him.

WHEELER
Tell the desk I'll be checking out. Thanks.

The Bellman exits. Wheeler collects his thoughts, rises.

WHEELER
(to Cooper, mind elsewhere)
Good night.

Cooper nods, watches as Wheeler steps away.

28. INT. BAR - NIGHT

The wine-tasting continues. Dick is hovering over Lana.

TREMAYNE
All right, class, what did that sip reveal to us? What
flavors are we enjoying?

LUCY
Tastes kind of woody.

TREMAYNE
No, not really. Anyone else? Lana?

LANA
Banana?

TREMAYNE
Yes, there is a hint of banana, that's the metachloric acid,
very good. What else?

LUCY
(under her breath)
Banana.

ANDY
Chocolate.

TREMAYNE
Correct, Andy, there is another acid, hydroxinine, which
is present in both flavors.

LUCY
Why don't we just skip the wine and have a banana split?

Registering, Lucy's mood, Dick pours more into Lana's glass, doting on her.

TREMAYNE
Let's have another sip, shall we, swallowing this time
and let's see what else we can discern.

LANA
Gosh, Dick, I never knew wine could have so many
different qualities.

TREMAYNE
Amazing, isn't it A really fine wine is like a
symphony. Strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
they're all present, playing in harmony.

Everyone sips. Dick turns to Lucy with a prefunctory tone.

TREMAYNE
And what reaction do you have Lucy?

She spits the wine out in his face.

LUCY
I'm pregnant. I'm not supposed to drink.

They look at each other.

29. OMIT

30. EXT. GAZEBO - NIGHT

Police cars. Cops. Lights trained on the gazebo, where a large box sits in the center. Cooper drives up, is greeted by Truman. They move towards the gazebo.

TRUMAN
We thought at first it might be a bomb. We don't
exactly have a bomb squad. It's weird.

COOPER
What did you do?

TRUMAN
Andy brought his metal detector. If it is a bomb it's
not metallic and there's no ticking sound, so...
(stopping Cooper)
Be careful, Coop, I think it is meant for you.

COOPER
I doubt it Harry. Windom is too precise. This will
have to do with some other itinerary on his peculiar
journey. When he tries to kill me it will be face to face
and far removed from chicanery or subtrafuge.

Cooper moves confidently up to the gazebo. Finds a small rope emerging from the top, with a ring attached and a sign that reads, 'Pull Me."

COOPER
Let's see what he's up to.

He pull the ring. A moment later all four sides of the box begin to fall to the ground.

TRUMAN
(to the group)
Get back!

Cooper doesn't move as the box falls apart. Revealed inside is a large black, papier-mache chess piece, a pawn. Sticking out of the top is the very dead head of Windom Earle's victim.

A sign on the pawn reads, "NEXT TIME. IT WILL BE SOMEONE YOU KNOW."

8. INT. DINER - DAY

Bobby and Shelly sit in a diner booth. Shelly holds a crumpled copy of her pageant speech.

SHELLY
(reading from speech)
"...and that's the only way we're ever going to save the
trees. It's time to stand up and kick some butt for our
environment. Before it's too late for all of us."
(gentle deadpan)
That's beautiful, baby. Letter perfect.

BOBBY
(the enthusiastic collaborater)
I'm not so sure about the "kicking butt" part. How 'bout
"Fight"?
(trying it out)
"It's time to stand up and fight for our environment?"

SHELLY
(quietly relieved, making correction)
Hundred per cent better.

BOBBY
(mind on something more important)
Shel ... I been thinkin'...

SHELLY
(putting pen and speech away)
I know, I know. The speech counts double everything else
in the contest -

BOBBY
I been thinking about us.

SHELLY
(looking up)
You were?

BOBBY
I know I haven't been paying the right kind of attention to
you lately. I got busy with Mr. Horne, I'm wearing suits,
okay? And suddenly I'm walkin' around like I'm more
important than everybody else.

SHELLY
You were pretty crummy. I was lonely, Bobby. I missed
all the things we used to do together.

BOBBY
When I saw you kissin' that guy, something snapped. It's
like my brain rolled over. And I could see all the stuff
that's special to me. The stuff that matters.
(takes hold of her hand)
I love you, Shelly. I want to dedicate my time to that I
mean if that's okay with you.

A beat. Shelly smiles, leans closer.

SHELLY
What do you think?

She leans across the table to give him a long, passionate kiss. Finally:

BOBBY
(quietly)
Lucky, lucky me.

Suddenly: an OFF-SCREEN VOICE interrupts:

VOICE
Shelly! Phone. It's the Sheriffs office.

Shelly reacts, steps from the booth to answer.

LUCY
What do you know about saving our planet?

ANDY
(after a beat)
I know it's in lots of trouble.

Lucy hands him a Miss Twin Peaks flyer.

LUCY
Andy, I'm taking fate into my own hands mostly
because the suspense is killing me. Tomorrow is D-Day.
"Dad Day." In twenty-four hours I will choose the father
of my child. Deputy Andrew Brennen. Or Clothing
Salesmen Richard Tremayne.

ANDY
(thrilled, frightened, confused)
What does that have to do with the Miss Twin Peaks
contest?

LUCY
I -
(remembering her baby)
We could use the money. We could also use a father.
(re flyer)
So I have to give a speech about saving our planet which
is a great concept but I have no idea how to go about
doing it. Yet.

ANDY
(looking up from flyer)
I do know that people have got to stop sinking their beer
cans in Pearl Lake when they're fishing.

LUCY
(grabbing pencil and paper)
Beer cans...

ANDY
And styrofoam never dies for as long as you live.

Lucy and Andy huddle together, consider man's fate.

3. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The conference room transformed into a command center. The blinds are pulled, it's hard to tell if it is day or night. At one end is the blackboard with a drawing of the cave painting. A MOVE down the table reveals computers, more paraphanalia. Piles of charts, library books, plus attempts to duplicate the dowels that shot out of the cave wall.

MAJOR BRIGGS, who looks like he's been up all night, guides Bookhouse Boy CAPPY through a reference book while pointing at the drawing.

BRIGGS
See if any of these symbols have to do with harvest
schedules or ancient calendars. Look for any curious
nomenclature.

CAPPY
Got it, Chief.

Cappy gets to work. Cooper and Truman enter, exchange greetings.

COOPER
Garland, you're exhausted.

Briggs gestures toward a small box atop his desk filled with files, notebooks, a videotape.

BRIGGS
I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue
Book files regarding Windom Earle. I found it
impossible to sleep after.

COOPER
What did you learn?

BRIGGS
Windom Earle was the best and brightest among us. But
when our attention turned from outer space to the
wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks, he became
destructively obsessive. Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner. Possessive of his assignments.
And finally, violent. He was removed from the project.

Briggs reaches into the box, removes the video tape, inserts it into a VCR.

BRIGGS
I found this in the Project archives.

Briggs turns on recorder and monitor. A beat. GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE footage appears on the screen. Slightly out of focus, as if gleaned from a surveillance camera. WINDOM EARLE, younger, wearing a white lab coat, faces an unseen interrogater. He speaks with quiet contempt:

EARLE ON SCREEN
(in mid-oration)
... these evil sorcerers, dugpas, they call them, cultivate
evil for the sake of evil and nothing else. They express
themselves in darkness for darkness, without leavening
motive. This ardent purity has allowed them to access a
secret place of great power, where the cultivation of evil
proceeds in exponential fashion. And with it, the
furtherance of evil's resulting power. These are not fairy
tales, or myths. This place of power is tangible, and as
such, can be found, entered, and perhaps, utilized in some
fashion. The dugpas have many names for it, but chief
among them is the Black Lodge.
(beat)
But you don't believe me, do you? You think I'm mad.
Overworked. Go away.

Earle turns from the unseen camera. The screen goes BLACK. Cooper presses rewind, means to view the tape in its entirety. We SEE Earle's, in black and white, image in reverse. Cooper speaks OVER, shares his thought as he forms them.

COOPER
When Windom Earle returned, I assumed he had come
for vengeance. For me. But I miscalculated. Windom
has insinuated himself into the lives of those I care for.
He has murdered innocents. He has engaged us in
subterfuge and red herring. But those acts were merely
camouflage. Windom Earle is after something else.
The Black Lodge.
(re Earle on monitor screen)
What I want to know is, what does that, the Black
Lodge, have to do...
(re the blackboard hieroglyph)
...with this?

TRUMAN
You think there's a connection?

COOPER
Windom does.
(beat)
Harry, let's divide up Earle's files, check them top to
bottom. Cappy, find out everything you can about the
evil sorcerers known as dugpas. Garland, maybe you
should get some sleep.

BRIGGS
I could use a good stretch. Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my head.

COOPER
Fine. Harry?

Cooper and Truman divide the files. CAMERA MOVES IN on a plant nearby. It's the familiar bonsai ... and the electronic bug hidden within.
CUT TO:


4. INT. EARLE'S CABIN

WINDOM EARLE, earphone in place, listens and laughs. LEO JOHNSON stands next to him.

EARLE
You know, Leo, the only thing Columbus discovered was
that he was lost. Cooper and the gang aren't even off the
snide, yet.
(studies the hieroglyph, in a sing song voice)
I know something they don't know.
(serious)
I know something Young Dale merely suspects.

MOVE BACK to see Earle has set up his own war room/command module. Bur Earle's work seems more advanced and he has more equipment. The familiar chess board remains.

EARLE
Project Blue Book. Little men - pee wits loaded with
optimism. They were a deterrent so slight it was
practically encouragement.

Earle refers to his copy of the hieroglyph, means to transfer the image to his computer screen.

EARLE
Yet, I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or
three. Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.
Perhaps, Leo, we too should venture out for a good
stretch.

Earle brings the copy closer, compares it with his computer mockup. The chess board is in the way. Earle sweeps it off the table. He is too absorbed in his work to notice Leo take the CONTROL for the shock collar off the table and slide it into his pocket.

5. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE, ATTIC - DAY

DONNA HAYWARD sits on the floor of the attic. Frustrated. She has been through a lot of boxes, tins, and trunks and not found a thing. She pulls down another box and behind it spots a SCRAPBOOK Across it's cover it reads, "The Palavan Club." As she pulls the scrapbook down documents fall out of it. Picking them up she sees that they are BEARER BONDS for HORNE INDUSTRIES. Mixed in with those is an envelope. Inside the envelope is a BIRTH CERTIFICATE that reads:

DONNA
(reading)
"Female Child. Mother, Eileen Hayward. Daughter
Donna Marie."

The name of the father has been left blank. Donna opens the scrapbook. She pores through the pictures coming upon a photograph of her parents at a costume party, dressed as hoboes. The theme of the party is written on an arch in the picture. It says, "Better Days." Donna whips through more of the pictures till she comes upon one that stops her. Eileen and Doc smile out at her from some long ago party. In between them is a smiling Ben Horne, his arms about Doc and Eileen.. Then there is a photo of Ben and Eileen together. Ben grinning at the camera. Eileen grinning at Ben. Donna stares at the picture until she is startled by her Mother's voice from below.

EILEEN'S VOICE
Donna? Donna where are you?

Donna scrambles to put the bonds and the birth certificate back into the scrapbook.

DONNA
What is it, Mom?

EILEEN'S VOICE
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.

DONNA
Be right there.

After one more look Donna hides the scrapbook.

CLERK
No sir.

WHEELER

CLERK
No, sir.

WHEELER
You're sure?

CLERK
Sorry, sir.

Nothing left to do. Wheeler sighs.

WHEELER
Would you send someone up for my bags.

CLERK
Perhaps you care to leave Ms. Horne a message.

Wheeler takes a pad from the clerk. Starts to write a note. Then crumples it up.

WHEELER
No. No. I'm afraid that isn't going to - Thanks.

Wheeler goes to the elevator.

6. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

Earle applies oil to his cross-bow, chatting with Leo, as is his custom, while he works.

EARLE
... you would have appreciated the dugpas, Leo. Ancient
sorcerers bent on evil. Rather like the Kali worshippers
of India. Another fine bunch of zanies, let me tell you.
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch ... those were the
good old days.

Earle looks up, sees Leo standing before the three playing card Queens attached to the bulletin board. Audrey, Donna, and Shelly. Leo turns to Earle, disturbed, confused.

EARLE
Do my anecdotes bore you?

LEO
Sh...sh ... Shelly.

EARLE
Yes. Very good, Leo. You remember.

LEO
Sh ... Shelly.

EARLE
Tawdry little trollop. Just between you and me, old
boy, your wife has some fairly modern views on marital
fidelity. No matter, she is still fit for a Queen. Would
you mourn her passing, Leo? I doubt it.

Leo stares at the picture of Shelly, then back to Earle. Uncertain, confused. Earle clarifies:

EARLE
Her death, Leo. Shelly's imminent demise. It's really
very simple. Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks. Shelly
dies. Maybe you'd like to help.

LEO
Shelly. NO.

Leo understands. He means to save her. Leo reveals the shock collar control, waves it at Earle is if the control, not the collar, delivered the painful shocks. Earle spies it, reacts with mock fear.

EARLE
My god, what do you have there, Leo?
(as Leo moves towards him)
No. Dear God, no.
(Leo waves the control at him)
I'm begging you, Leo. I prithee, no. Have mercy.

Leo points the control at Earle.

LEO
Love .... Shelly ....

Leo hits the control and shocks himself. He flips about, confused. Earle moves to Leo. Confused and frightened, Leo continues to pump on the control and continues to shock himself. Finally, Earle takes the control from his helpless hand.

EARLE
Poor, Leo. We are all love's fools, more or less.

Earle takes out a pair of shackles, attaches them to Leo's legs.

EARLE
But you will learn, as I have, the value of hate. It makes
for better company I assure you.

Annie pours, takes a closer look. Faint doubt amidst his ardor.

ANNIE
Something's troubling you.

COOPER
(surprised)
Yes.

ANNIE
Do you want to talk about it?

COOPER
(after a beat)
I am involved in a complicated investigation that
requires my total attention. Yet I spend most of my
time thinking about you.

ANNIE
I know the feeling. I've been seeing your face in fried
eggs all morning.

COOPER
There are those who believe in a scientific basis for
attraction. It's chemical.

ANNIE
Is that what this is?

COOPER
I don't know. Is it possible to understand without
perspective?

ANNIE
I spent five years trying.

COOPER
Faith.

ANNIE
It's difficult for me. But I have faith in you. In us, as I
understand it.

COOPER
We are very much alike.

ANNIE
It helps.

COOPER
But we think too much.

ANNIE

"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed

They share a warm beat. Kindred spirits from another time and place. Annie deadpans:

ANNIE
Maybe we should go bowling.

COOPER
No. Dancing.

ANNIE

Cooper takes her hand. They hesitate. Then, awkwardly, eagerly, they lean across the countertop to kiss.

8. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY

Decorations for the Miss Twin Peaks contest are being put up. A poster celebrating Norma as a past Queen is leaning against the podium. SHELLY JOHNSON and BOBBY BRIGGS rehearse on stage.

BOBBY
Shel, I know I haven't been paying the right kind of
attention to ya lately But when I saw that old guy
kissing you ... something snapped. It's when I realized what
I had or something. And I want to dedicate my time to
that.

SHELLY
(hopeful)
Sounds great to me.

BOBBY
(re her speech)
So let's try to get through the rest. And then we can
discuss it. Together.

Shelly peeks at her speech, sighs, and continues her recitation:

SHELLY
"Yes, I believe there are so many beautiful things in the
world that should be admired and be thankful for. For
example, Detroit auto makers reported a record year of
sales for sports cars."
(she stops)
I don't know, Bobby.

BOBBY
What's wrong now?

SHELLY
Well, for one thing, nowhere in this entire speech do we
mention ecology, or forests, or anything.

Bobby looks at the speech.

BOBBY
I don't know where I'd put it. The speech is so damn
tight as is.

SHELLY
But it's supposed to be about that.

BOBBY
Shel, you're gonna be wonderful. You'll win in a walk.
And then we are off. Fade out on Twin Peaks. Fade up
on Hollywood insider games. Sunset strip. Easy
street, baby. Just like you always wanted.
(steps back from her, examining her)
Maybe a new hairdo. Or some signature makeup. We
got to mesmerize.

Shelly sighs. Apology or not. He's hopeless.

ACROSS THE ROOM

LANA BUDDING stares nervously at her fellow contestants. MAYOR MILFORD hurries into view, sits beside her.

MILFORD
(he tries to kiss her, she turns away)
I've got great news. It's going to be Norma Jennings and
Richard Tremayne. Tremayne is the third judge. It's in
the bag.

LANA
I have to be sure. I want to be sure that I'm going to win.

MILFORD
My god, the guy's British - or Bahamian. He's bound to
fall for your charms.
(snuggling closer)
We'll find a chance for you two to be alone. Wear one of
those dresses of yours with the slit cut half way up to
Seattle.
(getting too excited)
Nestle up to him real close and when he gets a look at
those gams of yours and smells that French perfume
dripping off you and begins to drown in those brown
eyes and -
(he's lost it)
Oh, god, stop it. Oh, you vixen, stop it. I can't take it
anymore, why can't we elope and -

LANA
Not till I've won. Then and only then will I marry you.

MILFORD
You're so strict, darling,

And I am the g.d. Mayor!

It's no use. Lana will not be dissuaded. Milford takes head in hands.

DOC HAYWARD finishes giving BEN HORNE a physical. Doc is purring his stethoscope away and Ben is buttoning up his shirt. Both are tense.

BEN
The insurance company's sent me so many forms I could

DOC
You're fine. It's what in your heart that you should
worry about.

BEN
I know you have reason to doubt me. But I am only
interested in doing the right thing. For the good of
everybody.

Doc takes a long look at Ben. He believes him.

DOC
Then stay away from Eileen.

BEN
I can't. Not as long as the lie survives.

DOC
Dammit, Ben. It isn't that simple. I believe you. I
applaud your desire to do the right thing. But goodness
in you is like a timebomb. And there's nothing good
about ruined lives.

BEN
(kind, yet determined)
It is a confusing and difficult process. But I must
continue. I'm sorry, Will.

Wheeler sticks his head in the door as he knocks.

BEN
(happy for the interruption)
Jack! Come in. You know Will Hayward.

Wheeler is obviously upset. For the first time unsure. He tries to be polite.

WHEELER
I met your daughter the other day. Beautiful girl.

DOC
I think I should get back to the office. Nice to see you,
John. Ben, be careful please.

Doc goes out. Ben motions to the chair in front of the desk but Wheeler is in too much of a hurry.

WHEELER
Ben, I've been trying to find Audrey.

BEN
She should be back any minute.

WHEELER

BEN
Well, give her a call when you get to wherever it is you're

A brave man is dead. My friend. And now I have to
take his place.

BEN
(getting it)
You're not coming back. Damn this rain forest business
anyway. Why can't you...? Sorry, sorry. See? I'm
already backsliding.

WHEELER
You'll be fine without me.

BEN
(scared)
I don't know. I feel disarmed. I'm afraid that I'm weak.

WHEELER
Ben Horne? Weak? I find that very hard to believe.

BEN
Strive for goodness. Tell the hardest truth first.

WHEELER
Do the best you can. That's all any of us can do.

Ben sighs, offers his hand. They shake and then hug. Then get to their feet.

BEN
Goodbye, John. I'm sorry Audrey wasn't here.

WHEELER
(pulling letter from jacket)
Giver her this. Tell her I...

BEN
(taking letter)
Good luck. Come home soon.

Ben watches Wheeler walk out the door.

12. EXT. WOODS - DAY

Briggs walks through the woods, dog tired but enjoying the solitude and nature. He stops to inspect a particularly beautiful Douglas Fir. He runs his hands up and down the bark trying to remember something. He fingers the tattoo behind his head. From behind him he hears singing. He turns to see a COSTUME HORSE strolling down the path towards him. He stares at it, stunned. The horse stops singing. Looks it Briggs.

HORSE
Hello, Wilbur.

A hand comes out from under the costume and a dart/tranquilizer whizzes out hitting Briggs who wobbles away from the horse. He makes it about ten feet then topples over. The horse stands over the downed pilot. Briggs desperately tries to focus on the horse head as it bends over him.

BRIGGS
What... what?

Earle takes off the horse head.

EARLE
Long time no see, Briggsie.

He turns to Leo who stumbles about in the ass end of the costume.

EARLE
Leo, I think you have finally found your calling.

13. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

OPEN ON the three pieces of paper forming the poem. Cooper is placing them together. Shelly, Audrey, and Donna sit across from him.

COOPER
Each of you received a part of this poem. And each in a
curious manner. Along with an invitation.

AUDREY
We all went to the Roadhouse but nobody showed up.

COOPER
In the past few days have any of you had contact with a
stranger? Someone that sticks out as peculiar or
charming or just plain puzzling.

DONNA
(after a beat)
Well, there was that weird guy that claimed he was a
friend of Dad's.

SHELLY
The same day I got my poem I got a ten dollar tip for a
cup of coffee. That was pretty peculiar.

AUDREY
And there was a funny old guy at the library. He asked
me to read it to him.

COOPER
(confirming his suspicions)
All three.
(sliding the poem in front of Shelly)
Take a closer look, Shelly. Does the handwriting seem familiar?

SHELLY
(beat, a gasp)
It's Leo's.

Cooper steels himself against the enemy.

COOPER
Listen carefully. I want you to check in with the Sheriff
two times each day. Nine in the morning. Nine at
night. Parents are to know your whereabouts at all times.
When you walk to school, when you drive to work, I
want you to make sure that you do not do so alone.
(beat)
Please believe me when I tell you to be very careful.
You are in danger. We all are.

15. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

START CLOSE on the mysterious black box, now open, sent to Catherine Martell. CAMERA PANS, reveals the slightly smaller box found inside. Unlike the original, this box has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface. A HAND enters frame, pushes the zodiac signs. The filigreed squares give slightly, suggesting that the correct combination will open it.

CATHERINE'S VOICE
(over latter)
His servant woman, what's her-name, Jones, delivered it
shortly after he died.

ANDREW
Eckhardt's last request. A clever jape, perhaps. Or
something of value..?
(seeking a way to open)
Try the hammer.

CATHERINE MARTELL and ANDREW PACKARD hover over the boxes. Catherine ignores Andrew, presses the zodiac signs with increasing frustration.

CATHERINE
Won't work. There's a secret to opening each box, and
this one...
(exasperated, shoving the box away)
... is about to drive me mad.

Catherine pauses, seems about to hurl it through the nearest window. She turns to her brother.

CATHERINE
Tell me some good news, Andrew. Anything.

ANDREW
(fascinated by the black box)
Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit, from Paris
to Beijing. You'll get your golf course, Catherine. Right
next to the Great Northern Hotel.

CATHERINE
Ben's doing everything he can to stop us.

ANDREW
He's too late. When the project was still in his
possession, Ben cleared every possible hurdle. Zoning,
impact statements. He was, and is, his own worst
enemy.

Andrew's focus shifts palpably to the mysterious box. He pushes the zodiac buttons, tries different combinations.

CATHERINE
As always. What...?

ANDREW
Nothing, dear. Just trying a few simple combinations

CATHERINE
Let me.

Catherine tries to get at the second box, but Andrew will not give way. The mysterious gift inspires a possessive mania in both.

ANDREW
One minute, Catherine. Eckhardt's birthday, my
birthday, I know, the date the gift arrived...
(the box springs open)

CATHERINE
Give it to me.
(grabs the box, peers inside)
Not again.

She withdraws a third black box, a little smaller than the last. Andrew doesn't hesitate:

ANDREW
I opened it.

Andrew snatches the third box. And, before Catherine can intercede, sets it upon the table, grabs the hammer, and strikes it as hard as he can. The box splinters, opens. Catherine shoves Andrew aside, reaches into it...

CATHERINE
(hopes dashed yet again)
Oh, Andrew...

... And pulls out a fourth and final box. Small and slender, stainless steel. As mysterious as the rest. Catherine and Andrew pause to gaze at it, wonder what secrets are harbored inside.

16. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

The sun makes its way through the cabin's window.

EARLE'S VOICE
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?

An ARROW flies through the air, sticks deep into a brightly colored target. And just inches from Major Briggs, bound upon it. Windom Earle stands at a near distance, holds out his free hand for another arrow. Leo, subdued by his recent beating, complies. But when Earle turns back to Briggs, Leo's eyes follow him with newfound mental vigor. He's beginning to reclaim his senses.

BRIGGS
(brave to the last)
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.

EARLE
(playful, insane)
Cheater.

Earle lets fly another arrow, pinning Briggs right trouser leg to the target. And, judging by the spot of blood that appears, piercing some part of his flesh as well.

EARLE
What does the cave painting mean?

BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.

EARLE
Damn, but I love the military mind!

Earle fires another arrow, this one strikes the target just inches from Briggs' ear.

EARLE
(with fervor equal to the previous questions)
What's the capital of North Carolina?

BRIGGS
Raleigh.

Earle extracts an ampule of amber liquid from his jacket, then a syringe. He draws the liquid into it.

EARLE
Major, I admire your fortitude. Had I the time and the
patience, we might continue this game indefinitely.
However...

Earle jabs the syringe into Briggs' chest with sudden violence.

EARLE
...I have neither.
(turning back to Leo)
Catch.

Earle tosses the empty syringe at Leo. Leo dodges it. Earle turns back to Briggs. The drug takes hold quickly. Briggs struggles deep within a narcotic haze. Earle whispers, he means to test the drug's effect.

EARLE
Your name, please.

BRIGGS
Garland... Briggs.

EARLE
Garland, what do you fear most in the world?

BRIGGS
The possibility that love is not enough.

EARLE
Garland, please. I shall weep. How much does your
wife weigh?

BRIGGS
One hundred and fifteen pounds.

EARLE
Good for her. Now, when did you first see the
hieroglyph in Owl Cave?

BRIGGS
In...in dreams.

EARLE
What kind of dream?

BRIGGS
I went night-fishing with Agent Cooper. There was a
bright light, the guardian beyond it. I was taken, but my
mind...still I recognize the signs...

EARLE
What do the signs mean?

BRIGGS
(fading fast)
There is a time ... if Jupiter and Saturn meet ... they will
receive you...

A tremor ripples through Briggs. He begins to babble.

BRIGGS
Taht mug uoy ekil si gnimoc kcab ni elyts... Taht mug
uoy ekil...

EARLE
Oh, Garland. I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
(turning away)
Leo. Put the Major to bed. I'm afraid his mind has
begun to wander.

Leo steps to the target, removes the ropes that bind Briggs to it. Earle pauses to remember the last words he told him.

EARLE
There is a time... if Jupiter and Saturn meet...

Earle ponders as he repeats with delight.

17. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected upon it. Just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.

NADINE'S VOICE
...and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!

The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them, about to slam his hand on the mat to signal "pin".

ANOTHER ANGLE

NADINE stands, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:

NADINE
And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
supports ...
(a little sigh, sometimes it's too easy)
I pinned him in a minute five. Next!

One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.

NADINE
And this is me with all the stuff I won.

Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.

NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.

MIKE
(the enthusiasm of the sexually sated)
Way to go, babe!

Nadine leaps upon couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the he resulting foursome.

JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor -
(catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes. easier to talk about
our feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe
you would like to begin.

NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed
Mike's buns in the hall at school.

JACOBY
And...how are you feeling now?

NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean because I'm so
happy and I worry about Ed being sad.

JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?

ED
(god knows he's confused)
No.

JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?

NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.

It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:

JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?

ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.

A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:

NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.

That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

AUDREY
I got back this morning. But Agent Cooper wanted to
see me, so -

BEN
(genuinely, instantly concerned)
Is anything wrong?

AUDREY
Some creep sent me a poem. Daddy, have you seen
Jack? I called his room but nobody answered.

BEN
While you were away, I had the most incredible
brainstorm.

AUDREY
(expecting an answer, Wheeler)
What...?

BEN
(grabbing a carrot from his humidor)
The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson,
someone with a highly visible profile to inspire our
community to action.

AUDREY
Daddy, where's Jack -?

BEN
(man on a mission)
You can do it, Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you can
become that spokesperson, you can use your public
platform as a forum for environmental debate, you,
Audrey, and only you, can take our message to the
people.

AUDREY
(young woman on a different mission)
Ben. Where is John Justice Wheeler?!

BEN
(not insensitive, merely refocused)
Oh. He's gone.

AUDREY
Gone?!

BEN
(checking his pockets)
Yes. Tragic, isn't it? Some tragedy in Brazil demands
his immediate attention. He left you a letter, I have it
here somewhere...

AUDREY
When did he leave?

BEN
(finds the letter)
Just now. The airport.

Audrey snatches the letter from Ben hands, and races out the door.

Near sunset. A taxi sporting the sign "Tim and Tom's Taxidermy" and bearing a huge set of antlers on its roof rolls up to the lone jet on the runway. A voice is heard inside the taxi:

VOICE
Straight... hold... steady... stop.

The taxi jerks to a stop in front of the jet. A piece of luggage falls to the runway, followed by Wheeler, who pulls himself to safety from the back seat where TIM PINKLE sits. His blind brother, TOM, sits behind the wheel in the front seat. Wheeler stares at the blind man. Tim explains his brother.

TIM
He loves to stuff, and he loves to drive. Otherwise he
sleeps.

WHEELER
Well, I am very glad to have the opportunity to be
thankful for arriving here.

TIM
The pleasure is half mine.

Remember, we'll stuff anything.

23. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The war room atmosphere pervades. Cappy poring over maps. A computer screen and terminal. And Deputy Andy standing before the blackboard, peering intently at the mysterious hieroglyph.

Cooper and Truman share cups of coffee. Cooper peers at Briggs' calculations, sheafs of paper covered with figures and notations.

COOPER
The symbols suggest a time. That much is clear.

TRUMAN
A time for what?

COOPER
(pausing to glance at hieroglyph)
I'm not sure. At first I thought the hieroglyph was a
signpost. But what if it's an invitation instead?

TRUMAN
Or both.

COOPER
Exactly.
(checking his watch)
Where is the Major?

TRUMAN
He should be back by now.
(spotting Andy by the blackboard)
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call. See if the Major's home.

Truman turns back to Cooper, seees him looking off into the distance, preoccupied. The Sheriff assumes the usual brainstorm, wonders:

TRUMAN
What it is, Coop?

COOPER
(to the point, even now)
I was thinking about Annie Blackburne.

TRUMAN
(with affection)
I've never known your mind to wander.

COOPER
It's strange. I've been feeling this way all day. I
proceed as usual, mind clear and focused. And then,
suddenly, out of nowhere, I see Annie's face, I hear her
voice. Naturally, I attempt to reorient myself, return to
the task at hand. But her image remains. Sometimes I
feel dizzy.

TRUMAN
(faint regret)
Looks to me like a man in love.

COOPER
My symptoms suggest the onset of malaria. Yet I've
never felt better in my life.

Cooper looks at Truman, his sad expression. Love has torn him apart. And Cooper knows it.

COOPER
Sorry. I sound foolish.

TRUMAN
No you don't. You sound lucky.

WHEELER

I should have known a simple goodbye was out of the
question.

Audrey runs up the stairs into his arms. They kiss for a very long beat. Finally, Audrey looks into his eyes. No quips, no flirtation, no barrier between. Just the simple truth.

AUDREY
I love you.

WHEELER
I love you too.

AUDREY

28. INT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

Couples dance to a slow country waltz on the jukebox. A banner proclaims: MISS TWIN PEAKS, OUR 20th ANNIVERSARY. Several contestants are visible throughout. A stagehand sets up a microphone on the stage. Annie sits at the bar. She sips from a soda, looks about. She's waiting for someone. Annie reacts, peers at the dance floor.

Cooper stands amidst the dancing couples. He gestures for Annie to join him there. Annie demurs. But Cooper insists. He won't budge. Finally, Annie smiles, slides off the barstool, and steps into the dancing crowd.

ANNIE
I'm not completely prepared for this.

COOPER
Think of it as a walking embrace. Two people stepping
as one would step.

Annie slides into his arms. A perfect fit.

ANNIE
So far so good.

COOPER
Now follow me.

ANNIE
(wry)
We'll follow each other.

Cooper and Annie take tentative steps about the dance floor.

COOPER
Steady.

ANNIE
Two people stepping...as one would step.

COOPER
(pleased)
You've got it.

ANNIE
Genetic memory. Mom and Dad danced the Lindy.

Cooper and Annie find a gentle dancing rhythm, their bodies close together. A beat.

COOPER
I like the way your body feels against my body.

ANNIE
I was thinking the same thing.

COOPER
If I'm too forward...

Annie surprises him with a kiss. They settle more deeply into each other's arms. Then, quietly:

ANNIE
I want more than your kisses.

COOPER
For instance?

ANNIE
I...

Suddenly: the music STOPS, a voice intrudes, shattering the spell.

MILFORD'S VOICE
Hello? Is this on...?

Mayor Milford stands on the Roadhouse stage, taps at the microphone. All turn to face him.

MILFORD
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our
final night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
pageant. As many of you already know...

The microphone SQUEALS, a little puff of smoke drifts past the Mayor's nose. He looks about, addled, taps at the mike again.

MILFORD
Damnation. Is this on...? Hello...?

The microphone is dead. A STAGEHAND scuttles into view, attempts to replace it. Meanwhile, Annie quietly confesses, eyes straight ahead:

ANNIE
What I mean is, I understand why you treat me with
care. Why you hesitate. The convent evokes images of
helpless women fearful at the thought of emotions other
than those derived from scripture and prayer.
(choosing her words carefully)
But when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and
eager. I'm not afraid. Not of anything you make me
feel. Or want.

Cooper turns to her. They kiss for a long beat. Once again, Milford intrudes:

MILFORD'S VOICE
It's on? About time. Hello...? Welcome to our final
night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
pageant.
(muttered)
Oh, hell. Where're my cue cards?
(on mike)
Hello? Welcome to our final night...

COOPER
(without anger)
I'm beginning to tire of his interruptions.

ANNIE
(safe in Cooper's arms)
I don't know. He's cute.
(beat, sudden impulse)
I think I'll enter after all.

COOPER
The Miss Twin Peaks contest?

ANNIE
Why not? Local girl returns to strive for her crown. It's
like a fairy tale.

COOPER
And you, its Queen.

Cooper and Annie embrace in the middle of the dance floor. Slow motion FX. Cooper looks over Annie's shoulder, reacts. Music up. The GIANT steps slowly between dancing couples, arms spread, as if to welcome or warn. Cooper's circling steps take him in and out of view. Cooper pauses, tries to focus. The Giant cannot reach him. Not this time. And then, as quickly as he appeared...the Giant vanishes.

The cluttered interior of Earle's cabin. Earle's three Queens, Audrey, Shelly, and Donna - posted upon the wall. Briggs handcuffed to a chair, mumbling incoherently. Leo held fast by his leg chains. Earle works feverishly, referring to the Owl Cave hieroglyph on his computer screen, a series of maps, open books before him. The books are astrological in nature, various charts and planetary configurations. Just now: Earle completes his computer rendering of the Owl Cave hieroglyph.

EARLE
(giddy incantation)
If Jupiter and Saturn meet, oh what a crop of mummy
wheat...

Leo watches Earle closely. He seems more alert with each passing moment. And sympathetic to the Major's plight. Earle addresses him, teacher to pupil, gesturing to the hieroglyph.

EARLE
The planets that our babbling Major spoke of, are more
than distant orbs. They are, in fact, a clock. A clock
that tells a time. And the time...?

Earle looks to Leo for the correct response. Leo says nothing.

EARLE
The time draws nearer with each ticking tock. Dale
wasn't far wrong, the cave painting is an invitation of
sorts, telling us when the revels begin. But what Dale
doesn't know, is where to find it.

Earle's fingers dance across the computer keyboard. Calling up two squares upon the screen. The hieroglyph. And a map of Twin Peaks.

EARLE
For you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation...

Earle taps instructions, watches as the two squares move closer upon the computer screen until superimposed atop each other.

EARLE
...it is also, a map. A map to the Black Lodge.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. It's a perfect match. A beat. And the two images begin to vibrate, almost imperceptibly. Earle leans closer. Music up. The images vibrate faster and faster, the superimposition has unleashed dark magic. Earle smiles, delighted. Begins to LAUGH. Leo holds his hands to his ears, pained by sound only he can hear. The vibrations reach a fever pitch and... the computer SPUTTERS and goes BLACK. CAMERA MOVES RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DARK SCREEN...

JOSIE screams, trapped within the drawer pull.

CAMERA POV races madly through the woods, headed toward the Black Lodge.

Then, in an instant, quite jarringly - SILENCE, a grove of trees, the air still and calm. An eerie beat. An ARM coalesces in midair, inch by inch, now reaches about testing the cool night, fingers prodding. The wind begins to rise. Satisfied, the arm recedes, disappears.

A beat. BOB'S disembodied HEAD follows. Fierce winds blow, shaking the trees with mighty force. Bob's floating head peers about, now snaps back into a feral HOWL. Then Bob VANISHES in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

The winds recede. All is calm again. Save for the patch of SCORCHED earth below.

1. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

LEO JOHNSON and MAJOR BRIGGS sit captive against a wall. Leo slowly looks around the room. Does so again. Apparently satisfied , he rises to his feet and moves until the ankle chain snaps him to a halt. Straining forward, he is able to lean over a table, and takes something from its drawer. He then returns to beside Briggs, who still looks very dazed, unconscious of his surroundings. Leo, with great effort, fits his new possession into the lock of Briggs's handcuffs. Briggs is released. But doesn't realize it. Leo shakes him.

LEO
Save Shelly ...

Leo is looking up at the wall with Shelly's photo. Enough internal fog clears for Briggs to realize he is now free. He gets up unsteadily and stumbles away. CLOSE ON the wall photos.

Leo cringes, expecting another shock. None comes.

Twentieth anniversary of when you won?

NORMA
Listen to her, working on the judge already.

SHELLY
Since you brought it up ...

Good question: who are you going to vote for?

Ahelly and Annie put an arm around each other and present a united front.

ANNIE
Maybe they'll let you split your vote.

NORMA

We have a customer.

ANGLE ON DALE COOPER entering the diner. It's clear whose customer he is: to Shelly's intrigued glance, Annie walks over toward the counter.

COOPER
No question about it. You are.

ANNIE
You're not exactly objective -

COOPER
I am completely objective.

ANNIE
(softly flirtatious)
I think you're not as objective as you think you are.

COOPER
Perhaps that's why it seems so important to me that we
kiss.

ANNIE
(affectionate, not shy)
You impetuous boy. We have an audience.

COOPER
I know this violates multiple laws of physics, but at his
moment, Annie, and I mean this quite literally... you are
the only person in the room.

Annie beams. They lean across the counter to kiss. Shelly and Norma look on, smile, look away.

4. INT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

AUDREY HORNE stands pensively, her face half-lit by the fireplace glow. BEN HORNE enters, arms filled with books they nearly obscure him. Audrey manages a smile.

AUDREY
Hi, Daddy.

BEN
(pausing by the fire, nearly losing hold of a
tome)
Audrey. The most intelligent face I've seen all day. You
make the rest of us look like primates.

AUDREY
What's with all the books?

BEN
(listing each and every one)
The Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud, the Bible,
New and Old Testaments, the Tao-te-ching ... I have in
my arms those holy books that constitute the fundamental
framework of man's philosophies of good. Somewhere in
here are the answers I seek. I intend to read them, cover
to cover until find ...

Audrey's attention has wandered back to the fire. Ben Finally stops rambling, sees the sad expression on her face.

BEN
Listen to me, prattling on. It's Jack, isn't it?

AUDREY
He's only been gone a day. I ask myself how much will it
hurt next week?

BEN
Let me give you a piece of ageless wisdom culled from
these volumes: time heals all wounds.
(she starts to reply)
I know what it feels like. Believe me, I know. He'll be
back.

AUDREY
We barely had time to realize how we felt ...

BEN
But what you had was highly concentrated.

AUDREY
It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
(sigh)
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.

BEN
Jack's a man of his word. If he said he'll be back, he'll be
back, I promise you.

AUDREY
(moved)
You can't promise. But thanks for wanting to. I actually
came in here to update you on my Seattle trip.

BEN
(closes the book)
Update away.

AUDREY
(slowly turning her mind to business)
The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to
funnel cash for the Ghostwood Project, but the bank's
keeping a very low profile. They don't want the bad
publicity.

BEN
Bad publicity is exactly what they're going to get.
Audrey, have you given any more thought to the Miss
Twin Peaks pageant?

AUDREY
Daddy, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to be
the town bathing beauty.

BEN
Audrey, Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum. It
would be truly inspirational to have a winner with a
political sensibility that extends beyond makeup
strategies and recipes for cherry pie.
(the Horne twinkle)
And as you know, each contestant makes a speech to the
asembled town. This year's theme concerns our
immediate environment. And what we must do to
preserve it.

HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. Considering brand new strategies.

AUDREY
Maybe I'd better take a look through those books myself.

5. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM

START ON the cave painting reproduced on the blackboard: a cluttered concentration of various symbols, stick figures, stars, hieroglyphs. PULL BACK to ANDY BRENNAN standing myopically close to this drawing, staring at it with his own personal brand of awe. Cooper and TRUMAN, looking sleepless, re-enter the room carrying their coffees.

COOPER
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?

TRUMAN
Not today.
(Andy's beat; moving on)
We've still got people out combing the forest for Major
Briggs.

COOPER
Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book
Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.

TRUMAN
For what?

ANDY
Interesting.

They look over at Andy, who is still completely engrossed in the painting. Cooper and Truman are in proximity to the bonsai tree.

COOPER
I don't know yet. All of this appears to be flowing
together. Earle's been seeking access to the Black Lodge
as far back as 1965. This chess game may involve more
pieces than we'd begun to imagine. And then there's the
peculiar circumstances of Josie's death to consider.

TRUMAN
Consider them how?

COOPER
When Josie died ... I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this
before, Harry, but I had to take into account your mental
state -

TRUMAN
What is it?

COOPER
She was trembling with fear. Quaking, like an animal. I
might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that
killed her. And in the moment of her death ... I saw Bob.
As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time. Upon
reflection, I believe there's a connection between his
appearance and Josie's fear. He was attracted by it. He
may even feed off it.

TRUMAN
You see any connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?

COOPER
I think it's where he comes from. I believe the Black
Lodge is the source of what you've traditionally referred
to here as the evil in the woods. If that's what Earle is
seeking, it's imperative that we find our way in before he
does. There's a source of power in that place far beyond
our ability to comprehend.

CUT TO:


6. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN

Windom Earle, listening in on his shortwave set, springs out of his chair in excitement.

EARLE
Eureka! Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head. It's
fear! It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
(begins packing one of his silver briefcases)
My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been
staring me in the kisser. Leo, it's marvelous, a
perfect fit. These night creatures that hover on the edge of
our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's
their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis. And to gain
entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of
innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you
do not disappoint. Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock
appears and now we hold the key in our hands.

He takes the photos down and packs them, then closes the suitcase. He lifts the other case.

EARLE
Forgive my hasty departure, dear one. But the time has
come to gather my beloved Queen and embark upon our
dark honeymoon. I haven't been this excited since I
punctured Caroline's aorta.
(beat)
Leo, we must share a final sentiment ...

We still cannot see Leo.

EARLE
During our time together in this verdant bower, I must
confess I've developed something of a fondness for you.
Sounding board, companion. Ever obedient and faithful.
An all-around "A" for effort, Leo. Though I'm still a
trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs. But then
You'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you?
Goodbye, Leo. And good luck.

As he goes, we PAN DOWN to Leo, who is very tightly shackled. He is holding the end of a string taut in his mouth. We FOLLOW the string directly above his head and see that it is holding a large suspended plastic bag shut. Inside the bag are dozens of deadly spiders.

7. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY

A line of Miss Twin Peaks contestants in black dance leotards rehearse the opening number. They include, amongst some faces we do not know, DONNA, Shelly, Annie, LUCY, Audrey, NADINE and LANA. Standing before them, sleeves up, a cigarette bobbing in his mouth, is the impresario and choreographer, the ubiquitous TIM PINKLE. The piano player, TRUDY, jumps back into a show tune and the girls begin their chorus line dance.

PINKLE
Okay, one and two.. and three...
(doing the moves with them)
Step forward one and over and two....

The girls continue on their own as Pinkle steps over to a table and takes a large pull off his submarine sandwich.

PINKLE
(through his chewing)
Let the mood carry you... don't be afraid to be
vulnerable... and give me just a little more leg...
(beat)
Now bend forward, like sap in the... er, sapling in the
wind... a little further... very good... hold it for me... then
up... and out.

The song ends. Audrey eyes their trainer warily.

PINKLE
You girls'll need a lot of work...
(belch)
...but if you stay with it, I think I can make dancers out of
you.
(taking her aside)
Especially you, Miss Horne.

AUDREY
What kind of dance was this, Mr. Pinkle?

PINKLE
A nature dance, my little friend. A celebration.

AUDREY
What are we celebrating when you have us all bending
over?

PINKLE
Don't question the vision of your choreographer. You're
but a petal on the rose.

DONNA
(aside to Shelly)
Later it'll be the pistils and the stamens.

LUCY
Pistils and what?

SHELLY
(ruefully)
Don't ask.

NADINE
We're on stage at last. That's all that matters.

ANNIE
This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.

LANA
I think it't just the greatest thing that ever happened.

PINKLE
(moving back)
Once more with feeling, girls. I only have three things to
say: energy, energy, energy.

ANGLE OFF them over to a booth where the three judges, Norma, TREMAYNE, and Milford sit watching, and discussing.

TREMAYNE
If talent's to be any part of our deliberations, we'd best
close our eyes until Pinkie's done wrecking havoc.

MILFORD
(entranced)
I love a chorus line.

NORMA
(beat, a look at them both)
If we can focus here for a second, I have to get back to the
diner:
(back to the printed agenda of their discussion)
"What qualities do we think best examplify Miss Twin
Peaks?"

MILFORD
Beauty and power.
(drawing their look)
That's how I like 'em.

TREMAYNE
Poise. And... God help us... sophistication and breeding.

NORMA
I think a major factor should be originality.

TREMAYNE
Wouldn't that fall under talent?

MILFORD
Always nice when it does.

TREMAYNE.
Personally, I've always been big on style.

NORMA
That should be enough to work with. I'll make up the
score sheets this afternoon. I've really got to go.

TREMAYNE
Terrific.

She goes. Milford eyes Tremayne. Business time.

MILFORD
Score sheets, shmore sheets. We're set on this, aren't we
Dick?

TREMAYNE
Set on ... ?

MILFORD
She looks lovely today, doesn't she?

TREMAYNE
If looks could kill ...
(off Milford's hrumph)
Sorry Insensitive of me.

MILFORD
She'd make a great Miss Twin Peaks.

TREMAYNE
Wouldn't she just. But my vote is of course something I
hold sacred and will exercise with the greatest care and
consideration. As you well know, being a man who's been
charged with the awesome responsibility of running this
town.

MILFORD
(Still negotiating, voice lowered)
Alright, I can give you three hundred, but not a penny
more.

Lana, as if on cue (and quite possibly so), comes over. Milford signals her over Tremayne's shoulder.

LANA
(silkenly)
Hello, Dick. We're on break.

TREMAYNE
H-hi, Lana.

LANA
Do you think you could help me find something in the
storage room?

TREMAYNE
The storage room.

LANA
We're missing a very important prop.

The Mayor signals his approval to Lana.
CUT TO:


8. INT. STORAGE ROOM

All light comes from the hall. Two silhouettes enter. She shuts the door, closing them into DARKNESS.

TREMAYNE
I'm having trouble.

LANA
Just flick it.

A moment. His flashlight goes on. Its light nervously scans the little room.

TREMAYNE
Now, what exactly did you need to find?

The flashlight goes off

TREMAYNE
Lana?...

LANA
Oh, did I do that?

The flashlight goes back on.

TREMAYNE
(a wreck)
What are we looking for?

LANA
I don't know the exact, technical name for it..

TREMAYNE
Well, does anything in here look like it ...

The flashlight goes off.

LANA
I think this might be it.

TREMAYNE
Oh. By George, I think you've got it.

10. INT. GREAT NORTHERN/COOPER'S ROOM - DAY

Cooper sits crosslegged on the floor, perfectly still, eyes closed: he is deep in meditation.

Slowly he opens his eyes. Holds for a moment, takes a deep breath. Smiles broadly. Still crosslegged, he reaches over and flips on his tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane, it's 1:15 PM. I've just concluded my second
meditations of the day in lieu of sleep. I am completely
refreshed and struck again by the realization that we all
live at a fraction of our potential. We've been working
round the clock on the cave hieroglyph. I know the
answer is in that crude etching and I am now convinced
that Windom Earle is searching for the same thing we are,
and for diametrically opposite reasons. If I'm correct in
my assumptions about the power of that unholy place ...
God help us if he gets there first.

Cooper pauses, clearly shaken by the implication. Then, quietly:

COOPER
I want to make specific mention of Annie Blackburne.
Diane, she is a completely original human being. Her
responses are as pure as a child's. To be honest, I haven't
felt this way about anyone since Caroline. It's taken
meeting someone like Annie to realize how gray my life
has been since Caroline's death, how cold and solitary -

A knock on the door. Cooper rises to answer it.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Although occasionally there is something to be said for
solitude.

He flips off the recorder, opens the door. Annie stands before him. He admits her.

COOPER
You have nearly perfect timing.

ANNIE
That's not what our choreographer says.

COOPER
What can I do for you, Annie?

ANNIE
I have to give a speech in six hours. I haven't written a
word and I don't have a thought in my hand. I am in a
complete, sweaty-palmed panic and I needed to talk to
someone, namely you.

COOPER
What's the topic?

ANNIE
"What You Can Do to Save Our Local Forests." So what
am I supposed to do, stand up there like a deranged
Barbie Doll, "make sure you're campfires are completely
out, kind of like my brain."

COOPER
You're I terrified of public speaking.

ANNIE
Yes.

COOPER
(amused)
Our forests need saving because of the way people regard
them.

ANNIE
Expendable.

COOPER
If the Ghostwood development were going to cost
thousands of lives, would it have even the slightest chance
of going forward?

ANNIE
Trees aren't the same as people ...
(answering herself)
But they're alive.

COOPER
(extending the metaphor)
Your forest ... is beautiful and very peaceful.

ANNIE
Part of it's been damaged. I've tried to replant, but
nothing's taken root ...

They kiss. Tentatively at first. Then with greater fervor.

COOPER
Let's not talk anymore about trees.

ANNIE
To be honest, that's not really why I'm here. The speech.

COOPER
The way I feel transcends metaphor. Obliterates it.

ANNIE
How do you feel? I mean, usually. I only ask because ...
well, actually, I want to know.

COOPER
(an analytic detour)
My habit is to construct and control my emotions with
great precision. Everything ordered and in its place.
What I am feeling now has steamrollered every barrier
I've ever, if you'll excuse the expression, erected. I don't
know what I know or don't know. I only know ...
(happily jumbled, he sighs)
I want to make love with you, Annie. That's all I know.

ANNIE
Good.

COOPER
Do you feel the same...?

Annie begins to unbutton her blouse. A gentle ritual.

ANNIE
(beat, she removes her blouse)
I am eager ... and full of grace.

COOPER
That's good enough for me.

Cooper reaches for her. HOLD ON Annie and Cooper for a long beat. As they begin to make love.

9. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected upon it. just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.

NADINE'S VOICE
... and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!

The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them, about to slam his hand on the to mat to signal "pin".

ANOTHER ANGLE

NADINE seated, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:

NADINE
And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
supports...
(a little sigh, sometimes it's too easy)
I pinned him in a minute five. Next!

One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.

NADINE
And this is me with all the stuff I won.

Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.

NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.

MIKE
(the enthusiasm of the sexually sated)
Way to go, babe!

Nadine leaps upon the couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the resulting foursome.

JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor -
(catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes easier to talk about our
feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe you
would like to begin.

NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed Mike's
buns in the hall at school.

JACOBY
And... how are you feeling now?

NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean Mike and I are
hot. Miss Twin Peaks is tonight and Mr. Pinkle thinks
I'm a show business natural. I mean because I'm so happy.
I worry about Ed being sad.

JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?

ED
(god knows he's confused)
No.

JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?

NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.

It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:

JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?

ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.

A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:

NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.

That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

HAWK drives a country road. SHOT ROTATES away from him until we look out the windshield, where SUDDENLY.

A MAN steps out into the road, groping, arms extended skyward; he has no sense he's stepping out in front of a vehicle. As Hawk CAREENS and SLAMS on the BRAKES, he watches the zombi-like face of Major Briggs passing by.

Hawk pulls over gets out of the jeep and walks over to Briggs, who clearly does not recognize him.

Still very disoriented, Briggs sits across from Truman as Cooper rushes in.

TRUMAN
I waited for you.

COOPER
Thanks, Harry.

TRUMAN
Not that he's too talkative.

A beat on Briggs.

TRUMAN
He checks out okay physically. Doc ran a blood test ...

COOPER
He's been shot up with haloperidol.

TRUMAN
Right.

COOPER
Garland ... did Windom Earle do this to you?

BRIGGS
Garland. What an odd name ...

COOPER
Was it Windom Earle?

BRIGGS
(shrugs)
He was God, I suppose.

COOPER
Where did he take you?

BRIGGS
The woods?

COOPER
Can you be a little more specific?

BRIGGS
They were lovely, dark and deep.
(to Cooper)
The King of Romania was unable to attend.

Hopeless. Cooper and Truman pull away.

COOPER
This might take awhile.

TRUMAN
How much time have we got?

Andy enters, and without a word, walks straight past Briggs and up to the cave painting.

COOPER
Not enough. Let's leave him in here with us. Maybe
something will bubble up. Harry, we're in trouble. If the
door to the Black Lodge does exist, it probably exists
only in time. An object like a door normally exists at a
point in space and time. By way of contrast, a shooting
star exists for us at a point in time over a continuim in
space, but looking at it from the star's point of view
might be an entirely different experience.

TRUMAN
Sorry, you lost me.

COOPER
If we're not at the right place at exactly the right time
we'll never find the way in.

ANDY
Sheriff?...

They both look over at Andy, who remains fixated on the drawing.

ANDY
Could the 4H Club have anything to do with all this?

TRUMAN
Doubtful, Andy.

Andy continues staring. Cooper stands.

COOPER

Harry, you'll have to excuse me. I left someone waiting
in the other room.

TRUMAN

Guess this isn't a good day to fall in love.

COOPER
It's a great day. I'm just not used to feeling such discord
between my professional and personal concerns.

ANNIE
I'm not used to feeling what I feel right now either.

COOPER
Like a force of nature.

ANNIE
I think I may have found the inspiration for my speech.

COOPER
I think we may have found a lot of things ...

ANNIE
Don't say too much. You don't want to jinx us.

COOPER
No. I just don't want to lose you.

ANNIE

Go back to work. My heart will start beating again when
next we meet. My knight in shining armor.

He smiles. Watches her go. Hooked.

15. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

The room is spread with power tools, hand tools, gloves, soldering irons. PAN UP to a counter converted into a work bench, and on to a vice containing a small black box. Standing around the clamp are CATHERINE MARTELL, ANDREW PACKARD and PETE MARTELL.

ANDREW
This has to be the last one. Look at it.

CATHERINE
I can't take any more of this. Boxes inside boxes...
What's in there could be worth a fortune.

ANDREW
Maybe it's not a box at all. Maybe it's just a block of
stainless steel.
(beat)
Eckhardt's last little joke.

PETE
Be a good one.

CATHERINE
(rolling her eyes)
Let's channel some of that high wit into the job.

PETE
I just don't believe a little crumb like that can stand up to
this Cram Jack All Duty Vise.

ANDREW
Again?

PETE
Again.

Pete sits up on the counter, Andrew standing beside him. Pete locks his hands across the vise's leverage bar. Andrew leans against his brother-in-law, both hands pulling down on his shoulders.

PETE (CONT'D)
On three. One.. two... three.

Pete paratroops down off the counter, with his whole body weight against the vise bar. Andrew yanks down on his shoulders, but one hand slips free, causing Pete's vise grip to loosen for an instant, sending both Pete and Andrew to the floor behind the counter. Andrew stands back up and yanks the box free of the vise and throws it to the floor in front of Catherine.

ANDREW
(yelling)
The infernal box. It's heinous. It is slowly driving me
mad.

CATHERINE
Oh, good, Andrew, perhaps if you yell long and loud
enough it will open by itself.

ANDREW
Do you have any better ideas, Catherine?

Pete pulls himself back up from behind the counter using the handle of the vise for balance. He comes back down on the vise, which slams shut against Andrew's hand.

Packard SCREAMS.

PETE
Sorry, Andrew.

Pete loosens the vise, freeing Andrew's left hand. The man is in indescribable pain. He looks down at his hand. Pain instantly turns to rage. He pulls out a gun we didn't know he had. Pete's eyes bug out.

CATHERINE
What are you doing? He didn't mean it...

ANDREW
Where's it?

CATHERINE
Where's what?

ANDREW
There it is.

The tiny box. Halfway across the room. Andrew fires. It flies. He fires again. And again.

CATHERINE
Andrew, no!!

And again. And again. He puts the gun down.

ANDREW
Damned boxes.

Pete comes out from behind the counter and walks over to the far corner of the room, into which are lodged the box's remains.

PETE
Well, look at this.

They come over. Three people are bending into a tiny comer. They rise. In Pete's hand is a key.

ANDREW
A key.

CATHERINE
Where there's a key, there's a lock.

ANDREW
This should be kept safe.

CATHERINE
(with a suspicious look at Andrew)
And in plain sight.

PETE
You two don't trust each other?

A look at Pete. Then each other.

CATHERINE
Of course we do.

ANDREW
Like brother and sister.

CATHERINE
How about here.
(to the desk)
Under this bell jar. On the desk. In plain sight.

ANDREW
Splendid.
(she places it there)
So ... we have a key.

CATHERINE
Yes. We do.

She sits down beside the desk. Andrew sits on the other side of the desk. A beat. They'll wait each other out. Pete, watching all this, shakes his head and walks out.

Donna comes down the stairs in a black sequined gown, hair and makeup meticulously done. She enters the living room where Doc and EILEEN HAYWARD gaze at her proudly.

DOC

You look truly beautiful.

EILEEN
Read us your speech.

But Donna's expression reveals a completely different agenda.

DONNA
Right now, I'd prefer to talk about the truth.

EILEEN
What truth is there?

DONNA
Something is going on between you and Ben Home. I
want to know what it is.

DOC
Donna, don't talk to your mother that way -

DONNA
This isn't child-parent. This is eye-to-eye. I want to
know. Now.

EILEEN
Donna, I understand your feelings. There are things you
have to trust in. You're young and you don't see any
limitations -

DONNA
I now the limitations of lies. I know you raised me to
tell the truth. I expect the same from you.

Pause. Eileen and Doc look at each other, agonized.

DONNA
If you won't tell me, I'll have to find out what I want
from Ben Horne.

EILEEN
No ...

DONNA
Then tell me.

Silence. Eileen looks away.

DONNA
Understand. This is your choice, not mine. And you've
made it.

She heads for the door. Doc comes to his feet.

DOC

17. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Deputy Andy brings fresh coffee into the conference room. He pauses to resume his contemplation of the cave painting on the blackboard. Andy sets down the coffee, moves even closer. Truman and Cooper confer nearby. Cooper has surrounded himself with various books and charts. He finds something.

COOPER
Andy, take a look at this: it's what you mistook for the
4H Club; the 4 and H are astrological symbols -

ANDY
You mean like planets?

COOPER
Yes, they're the symbols for Jupiter and Saturn. Some of
these other symbols are planetary as well. What this
paticular part of the puzzle seems to signify is a specific
planetary position: Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.

TRUMAN
What's that supposed to mean?

COOPER
Historically, when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct, large
shifts occur in power and fortune. Jupiter is expansive in
its influence; Saturn, contractive. Conjunction suggests a
state of concentration, intensification. What we have
indicated here is something potentially explosive.
(mind racing)
Taking into account the earth's rotation, planetary
positions are specific down to the last second ...
(searching through books)
... and according to the Ephemeris, taking the other
planetary positions on the wall into account, this
conjunction will occur in our part of the world ...

His finger stops. Cooper looks up. Surprised, concerned.

TRUMAN
When?

COOPER
Tonight. At midnight.
(an intuitive leap)
My God, Harry, the door to the Lodge, that's when it
opens. That's what the puzzle's telling us.

BRIGGS
Protect ... the Queen ...

COOPER
(hyperfocused)
If the door is open tonight then something else here must
tell us where. We need to decipher the rest of this,
immediately. Think, anything that looks familiar ...

They look intently.

BRIGGS
Fear and love ... open the doors.

COOPER
What did he say?

TRUMAN
He said "Fear and love open the doors."

COOPER
(another flash)
Two Lodges, two doors. Fear opens one, the Black.
Love, the other.

TRUMAN
What does that mean?

COOPER
I don't know exactly. It just came to me.

BRIGGS
(a looped smile: Hamlet)
"How does the Queen?"

Cooper and Truman exchange looks. Cooper's on a roll.

COOPER
Of course: the Queen.

TRUMAN
Romania?

COOPER
No. The chess game's final piece. Follow my thinking.
Earle takes the Queen ...

TRUMAN
The game's not over until you take the King.

COOPER
That depends on where he takes her. Maybe he takes her to
the doorway when it opens ...

TRUMAN
Which Queen are we talking about?

Andy, as if psychically awakened by this climate of collective revelation, suddenly goes dumbstruck. For the first time, he looks away from the board, over at Cooper and Truman.

ANDY
Agent Cooper ...

COOPER
Not now, Andy. Tonight ... the Queen. But who? A
Queen. A crown ...

ANDY
Agent Cooper?

COOPER
Miss twin Peaks.

TRUMAN
Oh my God.

The two of them spring from their seats.

ANDY
Agent Cooper, please -

Andy comes over, crying to get their attention, and knocks over the Bonsai plant. Truman respectfully kneels to pick it up, and discovers...

TRUMAN
This plant... has a bug.

He pulls out and holds up the electronic device.

COOPER
This Bonsai wasn't from Josie. It was from Earle.
(doomsday pronouncement)
He's way ahead of us, Harry. And we've been working for
Earle from the start. What time does that conest start?

TRUMAN
Any minute.

COOPER
We've got to hurry.

They bolt for the door. Andy, ignored, calls after.

ANDY
Agent Cooper!!

END ACT THREE




ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

18. INT. ROADHOUSE/STAGE - NIGHT

BEGIN ON the exuberant, concentrated expression of Nadine as she lands to the downbeat. TRACKING SHOT of the other contestants, who all form a chorus line in their leotards and dancing pumps. A small band plays the opening number as we INTERCUT amongst the girls: Audrey's detachment, Shelly's enjoyment, Donna's preoccupation, Annie's awkwardness, Lana's sultriness, Lucy's disorientation, Nadine's hopefulness, and the enthusiastic, nameless faces of others. INTERCUT through the audience, showing the three judges, Norma, Tremayne and Milford, the troubled Doc Hayward, the inebriated Pinkle, then finally PANNING OVER to where the LOG LADY stands, watching.

The number ends to generous applause. Doc Hayward pauses in the wings, staring at Donna, hoping garner her attention. But she stares ahead, will not meet his gaze. Hayward steps to the microphone. He's got a lot on his mind.

DOC
Good evening, everyone. Hope you've all had a good
holiday. And welcome to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,
in which one of these lovely, talented young citizens will
be crowned Miss Twin Peaks.
(applause)
Now, commencing the talent segment of the show is Lucy
Moran.

Lucy steps forward, to the piano intro of Off Broadway. She looks awkwardly into the audience, shrugs, then breaks into a jazz dance that is shockingly good. The stagelight narrows to enclose her.

Backstage, BOBBY BRIGGS, tomorrow's superstar, wanders about in a loose-fitting suit scoping out the crowd for possible opportunity. Not much. At a distance, he sees the Log Lady and shakes his head.

BOBBY
Strictly small-town.

Turning his head in another direction, he then sees... the Log Lady. He quickly turns back to the prior spot: no one. Thoroughly confused, he marches on over to the second Log lady, who is standing off in a corner, working quietly and efficiently at a power junction box.

BOBBY
Excuse me.. did you invite family to this thing?

The question is met with a deep stare. Suddenly the Log Lady hefts her log, CRACKS Bobby across the head, knocking him over, and out. CLOSE ON the 'Log Lady' until we can see, behind her glasses, the eyes of Windom Earle.
CUT TO:


19. STAGE - LATER

Doc Hayward returning to the microphone.

DOC
Our next entry is Lana Budding-Milford, who will
perform a dance of..
(checking his card)
... contortionistic Jazz exotica. Lana?

Lana steps forward, to some recorded sensual Near East rhythms.
CUT TO:


20. INT. ROADHOUSE ENTRANCE

Cooper and Truman hurry into the Roadhouse. Already planning, eyes scanning the crowd for trouble.

TRUMAN
We're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the
place. They should be here within the hour.

COOPER
It's essential that whoever wins this contest receive full
police protection: 24-hour guard, house surveillance,
everything.

TRUMAN
Soon as she's announced.

Truman heads one way, Cooper the other. HOLD SHOT as Andy now arrives, frustrated.

ANDY
Agent Cooper...

CUT TO:


21. STAGE

... as Lana swings into the beginning of some overpowering rhythm stretches.

INTERCUT:


22. AUDIENCE REACTIONS

Hawk and Andy stand in awe of this exhibition. Trying to follow Lana's movement, their heads slowly, simultaneously tip in opposite directions.

In the judge's booth, Tremayne's mouth hangs open. Milford leans in close to him.

MILFORD
That, my friend, is an artist.

Tremayne is close to tears. PAN over to Norma, forehead in hand.
CUT TO:


23. AUDIENCE - LATER

Cooper moves carefully through the crowd, eyes right and left. Then he pauses, looks up. And spots a catwalk overhead. He pauses to wonder. Then turns his eyes back to the stage.

DISSOLVE TO:


24. STAGE - LATER

Audrey in the middle of her pageant theme speech.

AUDREY
There is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or
anything of value: and that is by refusing to stand by and
watch it die. There is a law of nature which is more
fundamental to life than the laws of man. And when
something you care about is in danger, you must act to
save it, or lose it forever.
(beat)
And that is what I, as Miss Twin Peaks or as Audrey
Horne, intend to do.

Applause.
CUT TO:


25. BACKSTAGE

Andy, continuing his search for Cooper, happens upon the still disguised Earle.

ANDY
Hello, Miss Log Lady.

No reply. Earle is just hoping he'll go away.

ANDY
Have you or your log seen Agent Cooper? I've got to find
him.

LOG LADY (EARLE)
(murmurs)
No.

ANDY
What was that?

LOG LADY (EARLE)
(hoarsely)
NO.

ANDY
Oh. Sorry. It's just that I've got to find Agent Cooper as
soon as possible. Maybe you could ask your log to be
extra, on guard ...

The Log Lady/Earle stomps away. Andy looks after, puzzled, frustrated. Something's not quite right. He spots someone across the room.

ANDY
(back to the races)
Agent Cooper.

Andy races off. CAMERA REMAINS. And reveals what Andy just missed. A siren horn attached to the backstage wall, new wiring, a timing device. Carefully installed by Windom Earle.
CUT TO:


26. STAGE - LATER

Annie giving her speech.

ANNIE
... and to illustrate my point, I'd like to read these words
from Chief Seattle, leader of the Suquamish tribe:
"Your dead... are soon forgotten and never return. Our
dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them
being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring
rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and
verdant lined lakes and bay and even yearn in tender, fond
affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return
from the Happy Hunting Ground to visit, guide, console
and comfort them."

A hush has fallen over the crowd. She folds up her paper.

27. CUTAWAY - CATWALK

Windom Earle, now undisguised, darts along the catwalk overhead. He attaches another device to a sandbag line, sets the timer. That's when Annie's voice catches his attention from below. Earle pauses, peers down at her with rapt expression.

28. BACK TO SCENE

ANNIE
Why have we all lost touch with this beauty? We tell
ourselves the world is not alive so that we won't feel its
pain. But instead we feel it all the more. Maybe saving a
forest starts with preserving the little feelings that die
inside us every day. Those parts of ourselves we deny.
Because if that interior land is not honored, then neither
will we honor the land we walk. Thank you very much.

She walks off to a salvo of applause. INTERCUT to show Cooper, who has been conferring
with a deputy, pausing to watch her exit with evident emotion. And Tremayne, who looks
swept away, and finally ... Windom Earle, in the catwalks above.

INTERCUT:


29. EARLE'S POV

His careful psychopathic eye SCANS the row of ladies, pausing a moment on Shelly; then Donna, and Audrey. We then PAN over to, and HOLD on, Annie.

30. BACK TO SCENE

Doc Hayward walks back on the stage.

DOC
Thanks to our contestants. The balloting will now
commence and we will then announce our winner.

CUT TO:


31. BACKSTAGE

Lucy has succeeded in pulling aside Andy and Tremayne.

LUCY
Have you both forgotten what day this is?

The two men look at each other. The answer seems too obvious.

ANDY
Miss Twin Peaks Day?

LUCY
Today is the day my unborn child receives a father

TREMAYNE
It was right on the tip of my tongue.

LUCY
I have decided that regardless of which individual is
biologically responsible ...
(looking into Tremayne)
... that I want Andy to be the father of my child.

Both men attempt to digest this. Tremayne is tremendously relieved.

ANDY
Really?

LUCY
I'm sorry, Dick, but I have to do what's best for little
what's his name.

TREMAYNE
Not at all. A sound choice. Heartiest congratulations,
Andrew. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have a vote to
cast myself ...
(his signature smile)
Here's to the children.

He goes. Not quite the moment Lucy expected. She glares after him.

LUCY
Don't sound so disappointed.

ANDY
(remembering)
My God Lucy, I am so honored you made this decision
and I promise I will be a great father, but right now, I
have to find Agent Cooper.

He runs off. Lucy remains standing there.

LUCY
Men.

CUT TO:


32. ANOTHER PART OF BACKSTAGE

Donna searches for, spots and approaches Ben Horne. Her emotions are near the breaking point.

DONNA
I want to know what's going on between you and my
mother.

BEN
(sincere, aware of others looking on)
Donna, I believe the wisest course would be for all of us
to sit down together and talk this out.

DONNA
NO.

BEN
(trying to comfort)
Donna -

DONNA
Old pictures and Horne bearer bonds in the attic. Love
letters to my mom.

BEN (overlapping)
Donna, I want to tell you the truth. I want to do the right
thing -

DONNA
A birth certificate with no father's name on it. What the
hell is going on, Mr. Horne? Why won't anyone tell me
the truth?!?

Tears form in Ben's eyes. Stunned, silent, overcome. He reaches for her. At that moment she, knows.

BEN
Donna your mother and I ...

DONNA
Oh God. You're my father.

Donna runs away. Ben calls after, he doesn't care who hears.

BEN
Donna.

CUT TO:


33. STAGE

The girls stand in a line back near the curtain as Doc Hayward speaks into the microphone.

DOC
It's now time to make the announcement. The winner of
the contest and our new Miss Twin Peaks, is ...
(opens a paper and reads)
Annie Blackburne.

Congratulatory screams of other contestants, who now hug the startled Annie. On the floor, the crowd reacts with generous applause. Cooper freezes, understands the danger she is in. Alert, he looks about the Roadhouse, determined to protect. Cooper remembers the catwalk, his premonition. He looks up. Someone is standing in the shadows overhead. Windom Earle. Cooper leaps forward. Meanwhile, an uproar from the judge's booth. Mayor Milford.

MILFORD
This is an outrage. She's been living in this town for about
fifteen minutes!
(to Tremayne)
What the hell got into you?

TREMAYNE
(very nearly genuine)
She gave a beautiful speech, inherent in her message were
words even the most craven among us can ill afford to
ignore -

MILFORD
She stole half of it off a dead Indian, she plagiarized that
speech -

NORMA
She didn't plagiarize, she quoted.

MILFORD
You voted for your own sister!

NORMA
And you voted for your girl friend!

34. ON THE CATWALK

Cooper climbs up to the catwalk, hurls himself atop it. He draws his gun, looks ahead. Windom Earle stands at the other end, grinning from ear to ear. As the pandemonium continues below:

COOPER
Windom. Don't move.

Cooper takes careful steps along the catwalk, gun aimed at Earle's chest. Looking out for traps, deadly surprises. Oddly, Earle says nothing, merely grins. A ghoulish apparition positioned in the far shadows.

EARLE
Dear heart. You are, if nothing else, consistent. As you
have no doubt realized, our little game of four-
dimmensional chess has concluded. And once, dear,
dim, Dale - you have left your Queen unprotected.
(a manic giggle)
Forgive me. I amuse myself. You see, twenty years ago I
made a promise. And tonight, I keep it ... in the Black
Lodge.
(whispered, antic)
Farewell. I must be going.

Earle holds up his arms to conduct an invisible orchestra. Then he slashes downward - and SUDDENLY the lights go out. MUTED SOUNDS of little explosives going off: smoke bombs. A COLORED STROBE LIGHT begins flashing, exposing in pulsations the growing pall of smoke. A SIREN then starts wailing through the room. Screams erupt in concordance, people are now scurrying about in panic. On the catwalk, Cooper races forward, lights flashing, smoke obscuring... only to find that Windom Earle is gone. On stage, pandemonium, the girls huddle in fright. A sandbag falls from above, LANDS on Nadine's head. More pandemonium, screams. CLOSE ON Annie, her own acute fear. Suddenly she hears a voice in the dark.

VOICE
(supernaturally gentle)
Don't be afraid. Let me help you.

A hand reaches out to her. Annie takes it, tentative. Once in its grasp, Annie is JERKED forward. Face to face with her captor, Windom Earle. Annie tries to SCREAM. Earle whips her away into the dark.

Cooper leaps down from the catwalk, now searching for Annie as well as his nemesis.

COOPER
ANNIE!

Suddenly: the siren STOPS. Chaos everywhere. Cooper fights his way through the crowd, eyes searching. Annie is nowhere in sight.

Truman hurries over. Cooper stares out into the darkness, hopeless. The strobe dies. Smoke is clearing.

TRUMAN
Everyone's okay.

COOPER
He took Annie. He took Annie.

TRUMAN
I'll get everybody on it. Bastard won't get half a mile
from here.

Truman moves off purposefully. Cooper continues staring out ahead. Andy arrives, at wit's end.

ANDY
Agent Cooper, I've been looking all over, for you....

COOPER
Andy, they're going to need you outside.

ANDY
This is important, that cave painting in the office, I
finally figured it out.

COOPER
What's that?

ANDY
I knew I'd seen it someplace before. I know where it's
telling us to go, it's not a puzzle at all ... it's a map.

Galvanized, Cooper stares at the unlined, boundless face of Andy Brennan.

FADE OUT:

THE END

Episode 29 - Beyond Life and Death

FADE IN:

1. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

Cleanup and commotion after the kidnaping. A smoky haze in the air. DEPUTIES clean up the mess Windom Earle left behind.
CUT TO:


2. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

Pageant GIRLS enter for questioning. They pass ANDY BRENNEN and LUCY MORAN in mid-conversation.

LUCY
- and the lights went out. I kept thinking: The lights are
going out, the lights are going out and then they did and
it all went black. And then I kept thinking: What about
hand signals? What good would they do us now? And the
baby. What if the lights when out in hospital, and you
were in the elevator?

ANDY
Then I'd help you have that baby right there in the
elevator in front of God and everybody.

They kiss. Andy whispers romantically.

ANDY
It's a map, Lucy.

LUCY
What?

ANDY
I figured out that the puzzle was a map not a puzzle. I
solved the puzzle.

LUCY
How?

ANDY
Suddenly I saw all the pieces come together. It was sort
of like that old game show, "Concentration?"
CUT TO:


3. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

COOPER hovers over the hieroglyph/map. HAWK and a second DEPUTY stand to the rear, impassive. TRUMAN hurries to join them. More bad news.

TRUMAN
Earle got away. Nobody saw him or Annie. Sorry,
Coop.

COOPER
(hyperfocus)
We know it's a map, Harry, but of what?
(pointing)
The giant and the little man from my dream are there.
Are they telling us to go somewhere? Damn it, where?

TRUMAN
Maybe we should try to find Earle's cabin.

COOPER
That's not where, he is - there's no time.

PETE MARTELL busts into room. Furious and shouting.

PETE
Grand theft, Auto. The Log Lady stole my truck.
(beat)
68 Dodge truck. Powder blue like the dust kicked up at
sunset. I tried to run after it till I saw those beautiful tail
lights turn and head up the road towards -

COOPER
(it comes together)
The woods. Ghostwood National Park.

Truman looks at the map with new eyes. Instantly.

TRUMAN
Here's something, Coop.
(shows him something on the map)
Twelve trees in a perfect circle. There's a place like that
up in Ghostwood, it's called Glastonbury Grove -

COOPER
Glastonbury. That's the legendary burial place of King
Arthur.

PETE
King Arthur's buried near here?

COOPER
No, in England. This feels right, Harry, let's get up
there.

They hurry to the door. The Deputies fall into step.

TRUMAN
Hawk, get Major Briggs from the infirmary, and see if he
can help you find Earle's cabin.

COOPER
You'll find Leo Johnson there. Maybe he can tell us
something about Earle -

TRUMAN
(to second deputy)
Call the State Patrol, I want a dragnet in those woods
leading up to the Grove, then you meet us up there -

Cooper stops at the door. Edgy.

COOPER
Harry, I can't ask you to go.

TRUMAN
Stow it, Coop. Let's roll.

They exit.
CUT TO:


4. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

NADINE HURLEY blances a large ice pack on her head, mind thoroughly elsewhere. MIKE NELSON escorts DOC HAYWARD to the door.

HAYWARD
Twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off. That should
reduce the swelling. Don't forget the aspirin.

MIKE
Thanks, Doc.

Hayward exits. Mike steps back to Nadine, settles on the couch beside her. Nadine stares straight ahead, into the dim future.

MIKE
Does it hurt much, baby?

NADINE
(from another time and place)
Who?

Mike lifts the ice bag, gently kisses the growing knot on Nadine's head.

MIKE
I'm sorry you lost.

NADINE
Who?

MIKE
(continued)
God, Nadine I was so worried about you. I admit there
were times when I had my doubts about what we meant to
each other, but seeing that sandbag hit you, I knew that
I'd practically do anything for you.

NADINE
Who?

MIKE
(deep breathe)
I love you. There I said it and I'm glad.

Mike gently cups her chin, turns Nadine's face toward him, offers a passionate kiss. But Nadine pulls free, looks at him with complete surprise. And a palpable lack of recognition.

NADINE
Who are you?

MIKE
Mike.

NADINE
You try to stick your tongue down my throat and then, as
some sort of explanation, you say your name is Mike?
What the hell are you doing in my house, anyway?!

MIKE
You, you brought me here.

NADINE
Bullpucky. Take a hike, bozo.

Nadine swats at him. Mike braces for a powerful blow only to fend off a feminine slap. ED and NORMA walk in the front door.

NADINE
Ed, get over here, this kid's trying to molest me.
(spotting Norma)
What's she doing here?

ED
(hearing a familiar tone)
Nadine?

NADINE
Put those muscles that aren't between your ears to work
and give this punk the heave-ho.

Mike, Ed, and Norma stare at her.

NADINE
(cold)
Norma, if you don't mind, Ed and I have business to talk
about. Not that it isn't just peachy to see you.

Nadine pauses to look around the living room. As if to see it for the first time.

NADINE
Hey. Where're my drape runners?

A beat. Ed steps forward. Gulp.

ED
Nadine, how old are you?

NADINE
What kind of stupid question is that?

ED
Humor me. How old are you?

NADINE
Thirty-seven, you moron.

ED
(weighing the possibilities)
Good answer.
CUT TO:


5. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Pete Martell's pickup is stopped on the side of the road.
CUT TO:


6. INT. MARTELL'S PICKUP - NIGHT

WINDOM EARLE behind the wheel studies a map of the forest. Next to him is ANNIE BLACKBURNE.

EARLE
Glastonbury Grove. Should be right up that path.
(checks his watch)
Plenty of time.

He watches Annie come to from the chloroform.

EARLE
Hello, sleepy head.
(stares at Annie, makes a face)
Boo!

ANNIE
(jumps back)
Who?

EARLE
Think of me as cancer. Or a heinous virus. Something
you can die from - horribly.
(laughs)
I am about to cow you for your own mortification.

ANNIE
Windom Earle.

She turns away. Earle reaches over. Pulls her hand from her pocket. A rosary is in her hand.

EARLE
Oh, man, what a cheater! Sister Mary Holy Water crams
for finals.
(grabs the rosary and tosses it out the window,
slides closer to her)
Hey, you want to know something? Cooper's birthday is
April 19th, 1956. That means his moon is in Aries. Get
it?

This is lost on Annie. Earle goes into a rage.

EARLE
You don't get it, do you, you pathetic little professional
shut in.
(quick mood change)
On the other hand, I've just spent two weeks in a cabin
with a smelly head of cabbage.
(grabs her)
Has anyone ever told you you look a lot better than Leo
Johnson? Smell better too.

ANNIE
(trying to be calm)
If you're going to kill me why don't you get it over with?

EARLE
Oh, we have much bigger plans than that, my pretty.

Earle reaches below his seat, takes out the Miss Twin Peaks crown and places it on her head. He kisses her passionately. She struggles. Earle laughs.

EARLE
I tell ya, doll, if I was ten years younger and could find
the heater in this truck - boy, oh, boy. Having some fun
now.

He opens the truck door.

EARLE
Won't you join me for a gambol in the grove?

He drags Annie out of the truck, and into the woods.
DISSOLVE TO:


7. EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

Truman's Cruiser skids to a stop behind Pete's pickup. Cooper runs to the truck, feels the hood.

COOPER
Still hot. They're close.

TRUMAN
(into his radio)
Andy, we've found the truck, get the patrol up here I want
the search centered from where we are now.
(to Cooper)
There's a short cut to the Grove up through here.

Cooper checks his watch.

COOPER
11:45.

TRUMAN
(breaking out his rifle)
We still got time, Coop.

COOPER
(taking out his gun)
To fear the worst often causes the worst. He's going to
terrify her, Harry. He did it to me. It's what he did to
Caroline. Face to face with all that's intolerable. All
that is evil.

TRUMAN
(getting his bearings)
He can't terrify anybody with a bullet between his eyes.
(starts up)
It's this way.

COOPER
I'm right with you, Harry.
CUT TO:


8. EXT. THE WOODS, GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

Earle and Annie enter the circle of twelve trees. Then Earle circles her, stalking.

ANNIE
What are we doing here?

EARLE
A momentary pause in limbo, dear. Please be patient.
Pity young Dale will miss all the fun. I always felt we
were sort of Lodge Brothers.

ANNIE
He'll find you. He'll come for me.

EARLE
(screaming)
Do you see him anywhere? Huh? Huh?

Annie seems very calm, closes her eyes, whispers prayers to herself.

EARLE
Prayers? What a revolting development.

Earle checks his watch. Frustrated. She's not scaring.
CUT TO:


9. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Truman and Cooper move quickly along a path.

COOPER
Harry, all my skills, intuitions and dreams have led me
to the threshold of what is completely unknown. Led me
in a direction I never could really see. In spite of Earle's
prideful insanity. In spite of my best reasoning, only one
truth is clear. Whatever is, is right.
(stops, to his friend)
I'll take it from here, Harry. Alone. Cover me.
(before Truman's protest)
This is how it's supposed to be.

Truman stops. Realizes the truth of what he's saying.

TRUMAN
Go. Go.

Cooper races ahead.
CUT TO:


10. EXT. GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

Earle and Annie in the dark grove.

EARLE
You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.
(railway conductor)
"Toot, toot, 'board." This where it ends and the fun
begins. Get ready for first class despondency and
madness. The bewitching hour looms brightly.
(Annie is frozen, glaring at him)
If only Young Dale had lived to see it.

ANNIE
He's not dead.

EARLE
Oh, Cooper's dead, alright. Gone and soon forgotten.
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Didn't I mention it? I
meticulously splattered his brains across the back of the
Roadhouse just before we left.
(chortles)
Poor studious little Dale. Never saw it coming. Not
even time for one of his pithy observations. You see, he
was too busy looking after you. Left himself wide open.

ANNIE
No... no....

EARLE
Same thing happened the last time, when he fell in love
with my wife -
(pulls out a knife)
I took the boy right to the edge that time, opened him up
like a zipper. Six months to put back all the pieces -
(Annie starts to cry, terror setting in)
Caroline, the unfaithful whore, she died quickly. Much
better than she deserved. Don't be so prissy. There's
nothing serious in mortality. Renown and grace come
afterward. In fact, they come right here. Here in this
place the nectar of life will be drawn.

Earle moves towards her. Annie screams, terrified. Behind her the doorway to the Lodge begins to open, a hole in space. Earle is crazed with joy. A benediction.

EARLE
"I tell you they have not died. Their hands clasp yours
and mine."

Annie turns and seems to be trying to run away, getting nowhere.
INTERCUT:


11. ANNIE'S POV

A kindly smiling MOTHER SUPERIOR NUN seems to welcome her ... Annie moves towards her, sobbing ... the Nun turns into Earle, who grabs her by the wrists and pulls her towards the gaping hole, just as ...


12. COOPER

... runs into the grove.
INTERCUT:


13. COOPER'S POV

Windom, not dressed in costume, pulls Annie through the hole.

Cooper runs to Earle, grabs his leg but it slips away and disappears into the hole.


14. TRUMAN

... rushes into the grove. Too late. Only to see Cooper disappear into the hole and it closes up after him.

TRUMAN
No... god... no.

Truman stands alone in the circular grove waiting for what he doesn't know. Andy runs up behind him.

ANDY
Agent Cooper ... Agent Cooper.

This scares the hell out of Truman. Andy notices the horse costume leaning against a tree.

ANDY
Sheriff, look.

TRUMAN
Stay away from that, Andy.

But Andy is already over there.

ANDY
No. No. There's a note in the horse's mouth.

Truman goes cautiously to him. Andy takes out the note and a net drops on top of him.

TRUMAN
(dripping)
What's the note say?

ANDY
(barely able to read in the tangle of the net)
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."

16. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT

Leo the prisoner sits there with the string holding the bag of spiders. He tries to yell for help and the string begins to slide through his teeth. He chomps down harder on it.

Morning. ANDREW PACKARD tip-toes through the lodge to the mysterious key enshrined beneath the glass bell jar atop Catherine's desk.

ANDREW
(sotto voce)
I've seen this somewhere...

Andrew has an idea. He rifles through the desk, finds a large ring of keys, tagged for easy identification. Mill Office. Cadillac. Tool Shed. And last... Twin Peaks Savings and Loan. He lifts the jar, fingers the key, holds it up for closer inspection, compares it to the first. Same make, same model.

ANDREW
The Savings and Loan!

Just then: the sound of the kitchen door OPENING. Andrew tears the tag off the second key, places it under the bell jar, pockets the first. He looks up to see Pete, eyeing him with disapproval. And pockets the first. Andrew hurries out of the room. A beat. CATHERINE enters, tip-toes like her brother toward the desk. She looks left and right, makes certain no one is watching. Then gently lifts the glass bell jar.

PETE
Oh, Andy...

19. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

DONNA HAYWARD carries a small suitcase into the living room, eyes red from crying. EILEEN HAYWARD follows in her wheelchair.

EILEEN
Listen to me. Please.

DONNA
I've already heard enough. Okay, Mom?

EILEEN
But if you'd just let me explain -

Both pause. BEN HORNE stands in the center of the living room.

BEN
Donna.

DONNA
(to both, to everybody)
Leave me alone.

BEN
Donna, it's not your parents' fault. It's mine.

DONNA
(anger and contempt)
My parents? Who exactly is that supposed to be?

BEN
(to both)
I only wanted to do good. To be good.
(remembering Wheeler's advice)
Tell the hardest truth first. That's what I did. And it
seemed appropriate, it felt good to tell the truth at last.
(quietly)
But I was wrong. You were all better off when I devoted
my time to lying, cheating, and stealing. And as for
me...

Doc Hayward enters, weary, holding his medicine bag, and sees this tableau before him. Hayward darkens.

HAYWARD
Oh, dammit, Ben...

BEN
Will, I have agonized and I have meditated and I have
prayed.

EILEEN
Ben, please.

HAYWARD
Donna, go to your room.
(to Ben)
Ben, I warned you. Get out of my house.

BEN
Can you forgive me, Will? After all I've done to you?
Forgive me. Please forgive me.

Ben steps to him, as if to embrace. Hayward grabs Ben by the lapels, forces him from the room. Chaos follows.

EILEEN
Will!

HAYWARD
Leave my family alone!!

DONNA
DADDY!

Hayward shoves Ben toward the door. Ben reaches a hand toward Donna, desperate, as if her shout was meant for him. Ben falls, STRIKES his head on a coffee table. Donna SCREAMS. Hayward kneels beside him.

HAYWARD
Oh, Lord...
(beat)
Donna, get my bag.
(she stands still, in shock)
DONNA!!

Donna takes one last look at Ben, the pool of blood forming beneath his head. And races from the room. Eileen wheels closer, pales. Hayward kneels an prays.

HAYWARD
I'm sorry, Ben. My God I'm sorry. Ben, Ben can you hear
me...?

HOLD ON Ben's face for a beat. Silent.

20. INT. THE BLACK LODGE

START CLOSE on Agent Cooper, his face filled with wonder. He occupies a dark space, limitless.

COOPER
Annie?

His voice echoes. No reply. Then a bright lights shines, and the GUARDIAN, cowled in shadow, stands before him.

COOPER
Where am I?

A RIPPING sound. A FLASH of bright light.
SHOCK CUT TO:


21. INT. MOTEL RECEPTION.

SUDDENLY Cooper finds himself in a shabby motel office, a raging wind outside, slamming doors, shaking windows. At the reception desk, a CLERK, wearing a bizarre orthopedic brace, a tracheotomy plug in his throat. The clerk speaks, as if to answer Cooper's question:

CLERK
Home.

COOPER
Is this the Black Lodge?

CLERK
Name, please.

ANGLE ON COOPER

Suddenly ten years old. A smallish boy in shorts and shirt.

COOPER AS BOY
Dale Cooper.

BACK TO SCENE

The desk clerk nods, inscribes. Cooper has returned to his adult self. The change a flashing metamorphosis, back and forth. Cooper reorients, reacts. The desk clerk has VANISHED. An OLD MAN stands in his stead. Solid, kind in aspect and appearance. Cooper pales.

COOPER
Father...?

OLD MAN
There are fresh towels in every room.

COOPER
Father, listen to me. I need your help.

OLD MAN
Cable TV. Including three adult entertainment channels.

COOPER
Please.

OLD MAN
And a fruit basket with our compliments.

COOPER
FATHER!

A beat.

OLD MAN
You will need a key.

The old man takes a key from a rack, holds it out to Agent Cooper.

COOPER
I love you.

Cooper reaches out to receive it. He touches the key, and...

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

THEN DARKNESS.

22. EXT. WOODS - DAY

Major Briggs leads Deputy Hawk through the woods.

BRIGGS
(mystic memory)
I remember sunlight pouring through tall trees...

HAWKS
(looking for tracks, finding none)
A common sight in these woods, Major.

BRIGGS
(realizing)
I can smell it.

HAWK
What?

BRIGGS
The drug Windom Earle gave me has apparently
heightened my sense data. Shapes, colors, smells. I am
bombarded, and yet...it's as if my brain were better able
to interpret and define reality.
(pausing to consider, big grin)
Wow.

HAWK
You might want to have Doc runs some more tests when
we get back.

BRIGGS
No, no. I'm fine. I imagine this must have been what the
Sixites were like.
(heading out)
Follow me.

Briggs now trots through the pines, a man on a mission. His brain filled with bright new information. Hawk follows.

BRIGGS
My God the flowers, can you hear them?

HAWK
No.

BRIGGS
The wind passing through their petals has a distinctive
quality quite different from the pine boughs above us.
Look. There we are. This way.

Briggs bounds into the distance.

23. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

Leo furiously works at the string in his mouth, trying to increase his grip on the lifeline. His hands tug at the shackles, remain bound. Leo looks at the string with crossed eyes, sees that his saliva is causing it to weaken and fray. Leo emits a little humming moan.

Suddenly: FOOTSTEPS outside the cabin. Hawk and Major Briggs charging forward. Leo reacts, hopeful. The door BURSTS open, Hawk enters first, gun in hand. Briggs follows. Leo can't help it, he sighs, smiles -

LEO
Hi -
(realizing his fatal mistake)
- WHAAAAAA!!

24. EXT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

The cabin exterior. Leo SCREAMING. The SOUND of Hawk and Briggs rushing to the rescue. GUNSHOTS. More SCREAMING.

Audrey takes determined steps toward the Savings and Loan, carrying a small black doctor's bag.
CUT TO:


26. INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

Audrey steps through the interior. She is greeted by the Savings and Loan's unctuous manager, DELL MIBBLER.

MIBBLER
Audrey. Horne. This is a welcome surprise...

AUDREY
(mind on her mission)
Morning, Mr. Mibbler.

Audrey walks right past him, toward the bank vault to the rear.

MIBBLER
(calling after)
Is there something I do for you? Miss Horne?

At the vault bars, Audrey sets down the black bag, digs inside it.

AUDREY
As a matter of fact, there is.

Audrey pulls a long length of chain from the bag, runs it through the vault bars.

AUDREY
I want you to call the Twin Peaks Gazette.

MIBBLER
Er, Miss Horne...?

AUDREY
Ask for Dwayne Milford Jr. He's the Editor.

Audrey wraps the chain around her waist, attaching her torso to the vault bars. She removes a wicked looking padlock from the valise.

MIBBLER
Dwayne Milford Jr...
(snapping to)
Miss Horne, if I may ask a simple question -

AUDREY
(a rehearsed statement)
Tell him that Audrey Horne has chained herself to the
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan vault to protest their
financial ties to the Ghostwood Development Project,
and that she intends to stay here until a town meeting is
held to debate the future of our environment, and,
specifically, the effect of the Ghostwood Project upon it.

Audrey pauses to snap the padlock in place. She smiles at Mibbler.

AUDREY
Could you get me a glass of water please?
CUT TO:


27. INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

Andrew steps through the interior, spots Savings and Loan manager Mibbler speaking heatedly into a telephone. Pete toddling along behind him. He spots Saving and Loan Manager Mibbler speaking heatedly into a telephone.

ANDREW
Dell Mibbler, as I live and breathe...

Mibbler looks up from the phone, blanches. His day goes from bad to surreal.

MIBBLER
You ... you...you ... you...

ANDREW PETE
Yes, Dell. It's me. Alive. He's alive.

MIBBLER
(sucking up despite insurmountable odds)
You look fabulous. And the funeral, well, the flowers, the
boy's choir, it...

ANDREW
I was hoping you could do me a small favor.

MIBBLER
(dazed)
Anything.

ANDREW
(pulling mystery key from pocket)
Does this look familiar to you?

MIBBLER
It's one of our safety deposit keys.

ANDREW
(stepping toward vault)
Shall we?

MIBBLER
(following)
Of course. There is one small problem...

Andrew and Pete stops short, sees Audrey chained to the vault bars.

ANDREW PETE
Hello, young lady. Audrey.

AUDREY
Hello. Hi Pete.

ANDREW
Young lady, wWhy are you chained to the bank vault?

AUDREY
Civil disobedience.

ANDREW
Ahh. "Waste no time arguing what a good man should be.
Be one." Marcus Aurelius. I admire your verve.
(to the harried bank manager)
I see no problem here...
(to Audrey)
If you'll excuse us, please?

AUDREY
Sure.

Mibbler sighs, reaches for a large ring of keys, opens the vault door. Audrey scoots forward, allowing Andrew room to enter.

AUDREY
(to Mibbler)
Did you call the Gazette yet? The Sheriff too, probably.
Ask for Agent Cooper

Mibbler throws up his hands, mutters off. Audrey calls after.

AUDREY
And don't forget the water!
CUT TO:


28. THE BANK VAULT

Andrew runs his hands along the wall of safety deposit boxes, finds the matching number. Pete worries at his side.

PETE
I'd feel a whole lot better about this if we let Catherine in
on our little secret.

ANDREW
(enjoying the pun, eyes on deposit box)
Oh, for Pete's sake. Isn't it time you stood on your hind
legs and howled like a man?

PETE
Frankly... no.

Inside the vault, Andrew sticks the key into the safety deposit box.

CUT TO:


29. INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

Catherine Martell hurries in the savings and loan entrance.

Inside the vault, Andrew sticks the key into the safety deposit box.

Catherine races toward the bank vault.

CATHERINE
Andrew!! You promised me!!

Mibbler returns to Audrey with a glass of water.

MIBBLER
Miss Horne, is there anything I can do to convince you to
give up this doomed enterprise?

AUDREY
(takes the water)
Not really. Sometimes a woman's got to do what a
woman's got to do.

MIBBLER
But I'm still not certain exactly what it is you're doing.

Andrew turns the key, OPENS the safety deposit box. A HISSING sound is heard. Andrew is momentarily startled. He sees a note that reads: GOT YOU, ANDREW. LOVE, THOMAS.

Audrey looks up at Mibbler, sees Catherine running toward her. flashes a winning, memorable smile.
SHOCK CUT TO:


30. EXT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

The Savings and Loan EXPLODES, windows shattering outward, glass raining down upon the sunny street.
CUT TO:


31. EXT. WOODS - DAY

Truman sits on a rock near the circular grove, staring into the now-closed gateway, a mask of determination. Andy approaches circumspectly. Pause.

ANDY
You sure you don't want anything to eat?

TRUMAN
No.

ANDY
'Cause I could call the diner they could bring something
out.

TRUMAN
If you're hungry, Andy, call. I don't want anything. I'm
not moving from here until we know where they went and
when they're coming back.

ANDY
(pause; loyal and sad)
Okay.

Andy wanders back down towards the cruiser. Truman continues to stare at the grove.

INTERCUT:


32. TRUMAN'S POV

Near the center of the grove the air seem to shift shape, move and alter.

Truman stands, moves closer.

A GLEAMING WHITE SHIELD appears in the oscillating air and from behind it a hand holding a SILVER SWORD.

Truman is mesmerized.

He now sees that holding the shield and sword is a tall, dark WOMAN, wearing a glittering chain mail. She sees Truman, holds the sword out towards him.

TRUMAN
Oh my God... oh my God.

In a loud snap, image of the woman vanishes and we ...
CUT TO:


33. A BLACK CORRIDOR

A dark, ominous version of the Great Northern. Everything in black and white, including the checkboard floor. Cooper turns a corner and starts towards us, moving cautiously, glancing in all directions.

Looking ahead, he sees someone approaching him. He moves closer and realizes it's a version of himself, dressed identically, identical in every detail, but upon closer scrutiny realizes the figure's face is smooth and blank, his eyes gleaming, lifeless and black as ebony, no white cornea visible.

A door swings open to Cooper's left and another to his right. Looking through the left door he sees Windom Earle far down a corridor, beckoning to him.

Looking through the right door he sees Annie.

COOPER
Annie!

The door SLAMS in his face.

END ACT THREE




ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

34. INT. BLACK CORRIDOR

Cooper struggles with the door, can't open it.

WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
You're going about this all wrong, Dale.

Cooper stops, tries to locate the source of the voice.

WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
We'll profit not at all from resisting what there is to
experience here. That much I do know. Still, an entire
life of research and contemplation can't begin to prepare
one for the actual experience of being here.

COOPER
Where are we?

WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
Speaking for myself, I'm up here. No, up here.

Cooper looks up. Earle is floating ten feet off the ground some distance away.

EARLE
Think of us as astronauts. And when you do, think of us
fondly. I could hazard a guess at the physics but why
spoil the fun?

COOPER
What is this place?

EARLE
Where do you think we are, dummy?

COOPER
The Black Lodge.

Earle points the shock remote at him and presses the button: a burst of energy hits Cooper and a loud BUZZING sound is heard.

EARLE
Good answer. I've always hoped my endless hours of
mentoring might CONTRIBUTE to the development
of a fertile MIND. You were such a dullard, Coopy, such
an earnest, plodding, do-gooding Eagle Scout - it was
all I could do sometimes to keep myself from
SHREDDING YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS OUT OF
GENERAL PRINCIPLE!

COOPER
(hiding his alarm)
You were too smart for me, Windom.

EARLE
Don't prostrate yourself, dear boy. You're a tool, a useful
one, granted, but it can't very well be said that we play in
the same league, now can it?

COOPER
You were always looking for this.

EARLE
That's right. And what were you looking for, in your
endless perambulations? Oh, I know all about those three
"missing years," Tibet and your pathetic eager-beaver
globetrotring quest for enlightenment. In that one respect
we aren't so radically different. Perhaps that's why I've
tolerated you for as long as I did. Because I knew that,
one day, you would prove useful.

COOPER
Useful for what?

EARLE
Why do you think, silly boy? For FUN.

He points the remote at him again and presses the button. A blinding flash of light.
CUT TO:


35. INT. RED ROOM

Cooper comes to, lying on the floor of the red room. He rouses himself, looks around. Hearing someone humming.

COOPER
Where am I?

A crude, hand-painted sign falls into view. It reads: PITTSBURGH, STUPID. The sign flies up out of sight.

Cooper locates the source of the humming: a WOMAN in a pretty dress stands with her back to him, at a sink in a small kitchen area.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline ... oh my God ... Caroline?

No response. The humming grows louder. Cooper advances on the figure.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline?

The humming stops. The figure tenses but doesn't turn. Cooper moves closer.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline, it's me ... it's Dale.

Cooper is right behind the figure. He slowly reaches a hand out, touches the figure tentatively on the shoulder. We hear a low GROWLING and then the figure turns. It's Annie. As
Caroline.

ANNIE
Dale, oh my God, you startled me. I thought it might be
Windom.
(she embraces him)
Thank God you're here, I've missed you so much.

COOPER
(genuinely)
I've missed you too.

ANNIE
I've been so frightened. I had the most terrible dream.

COOPER
What was it?

ANNIE
I saw the face of the man. The face of the man who killed
me.

Cooper draws back.

ANNIE (CONTINUED)
I know who it is. It's the same man who kidnapped me,
the man who gave me the drug. It was Windom, Dale. It
was him all along.

Cooper stares at her.

ANNIE (CONTINUED)
What's the matter? Don't you believe me? It's my
husband. He's the killer. He's the one I saw. We've got
to stop him.

COOPER
You said the face of the man who killed you.

ANNIE
Did I? You must be mistaken. I'm alive.

Pause. Cooper seems close to tears.

COOPER
... Annie?

ANNIE
Who's Annie?

Cooper looks around. Speaks to the unseen Earle.

COOPER
Leave her alone. Tell me what you want, just leave her
alone.


36. A spotlight comes up on Earle, in top hat and tails. Big band music. Earle sings.

EARLE
"Long ago a glimpse of stocking was looked on as
something, now Heaven knows, anything goes."

The light blacks out. Cooper turns back the other way and sees ...


37. A SHADOWY FIGURE ...

...lurking behind Annie, in a slouch hat, holding a long, thin gleaming medical instrument.

COOPER
Windom...

Windom looks up from under the hat and winks at him, then directs Cooper's attention to
another part of the room where ...


38. A distraught Earle ...

... sits with two POLICE OFFICERS, describing a crime scene.

EARLE
I came in the door. There was blood on the kitchen
floor. I followed it into the living room ... that's where
they were lying ...

Cooper looks over and sees ... Annie, pale and quite obviously dead, lying in the arms of Cooper's "double" ...

EARLE (CONTINUED)
I thought they were both dead. I knew that because I
stabbed them myself.

Earle reveals the medical instrument. Blood on its tip. The double opens its black, lifeless eyes and stares at Cooper.

COOPER
Don't do this. Don't hurt her. Tell me what you want!
CUT TO:


39. THE BLACK CORRIDOR

Cooper and Earle are standing side by side.

EARLE
(casual as an old school chum)
That's more like it. Sorry to put you through that, old
boy, but I did need to secure your cooperation. Don't
worry about your girlfriend. She's alive, of course -

COOPER
What do you want?

EARLE
Actually, I need you to volunteer for something. A
mission for a man of singular quality -

COOPER
Tell me.

EARLE
(friendly and jovial)
Come along with me.

He opens a door. Gestures for Cooper to precede him. Cooper does. Earle follows.
CUT TO:


40. NT. THRONE ROOM

A black and white doctor's office. Plain. Non-threatening. Two steps lead up to a dentist's chair on a elevated rostrum.

EARLE
Some people, I won't name names, they call the place
Hell. I don't have to tell you what they call the other
place. Needless to say, they've got it all backwards.
This is the place of power. The other's a revolting
mixture of milk-curdling sentimentality and bland
acquiescence to the cosmic equivalent of good table
manners. See, there's Annie.

He points casually to a medical supply cabinet, where Annie is trapped, alive, behind glass.

EARLE (CONTINUED)
In case of emergency, break glass.
(turning back to Cooper)
Here's the deal, Dale. Throne room. Windom.
Windom sits on throne. Windom king. Windom happy.
Problem: Windom need to make deposit first. That's
how it works. Windom can't make deposit all by
himself. Windom un-happy.

COOPER
What kind of deposit?

EARLE
Here's where the designers show their ingenuity. In return
for the best seat in the house they want something in
return. Guess what: voluntarily offered, no strings
attached, by its owner and operator ... the soul of a good
human being. Naturally something I have in very short
supply.
(close to him)
That's where you come in.

COOPER
You'll let her go. You'll let her live.

EARLE
(smiles)
Why, Dale, it's as if you read my mind.

COOPER
All right, let's do it. Now. Fast.

EARLE
Lovely. Stand over there.

A light illuminates a single square of the black and white checkerboard floor. Cooper moves to it. Another light illuminates the dentist chair. A third hits Annie. Everything else goes BLACK. Earle moves to the dentist chair, sits and sing happily.

EARLE (CONTINUED)
"Back in the saddle again, out where an Indian's your
friend, where everything is green and you can pee right
into the stream ... back in the saddle again."

A rumbling SOUND. Something approaching. Earle sits back and claps his hands like an excited child. A DOOR OPENS. A MAN in a version of a white dentist's smock enters, pushing a covered tray. We can't see his face. He stops next to the chair.

EARLE (CONTINUED)
Oh goody.

Suddenly clamps spring out of the arms and legs of the chair. Another slithers around Windom's neck while yet another gags him.

The Dentist uncovers the table, revealing an array of loathsome medical instruments. The Dentist picks up a particularly nasty one, a huge syringe, and turns to face them ... it's killer BOB. Earle squirms, screams. We hear Bob's voice, but his lips don't move.

BOB'S VOICE
(to Cooper, moving towards him)
If you know what's good for you, and you do, don't
move.
(Cooper doesn't)
The fool broke the rules: it's really no good if you don't
volunteer. Doesn't count if you're coerced. He'll have to
be punished and he will be ...
(close to him)
Of course that doesn't mean we have to let you go. This
is for extracting.

Bob grins and is about to use the syringe on Cooper when a HAND reaches in and stops him. They both turn to look and see ... Laura. Alarm on. Bob's face. A SOUND of two tremendous energies colliding. A WHITE LIGHT fills the room. Cooper looks to Annie, who's calling for him silently.
FADE TO WHITE:


FADE IN:

41. EXT. WOODS - DAY

Fighting off fatigue, Truman moves around, stretching. Looking back to the grove he sees someone lying in its center. Truman runs to them. It's Cooper and Annie, both unconscious.

TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper!
(into his walkie-talkie)
Andy, get that ambulance up here right now - Cooper?

He realizes there's blood on Annie's blouse. Cooper opens his eyes.

TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Coop, you okay? Coop? You okay?

Cooper slowly shakes his head and closes his eyes again. SOUND of a siren in the distance.
DISSOLVE TO:


42. INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Wearing pajamas, Cooper lies in bed. Doc Hayward and Truman attend him. Cooper opens his eyes again.

DOC
Here he is.

TRUMAN
Coop ...

COOPER
Where am I?

TRUMAN
Your room at the Great Northern. Annie's gonna be okay.
She's in the hospital.

Pause.

DOC
You've had quite a shock. Everything checks out, though.
You're going to be fine.

TRUMAN
I can't tell you how worried we were. I saw you
disappear. God almighty ...

COOPER
(pause)
I'd like to brush my teeth.

TRUMAN
Okay, sure, good.
Let me help you up.

They help him to his feet.

COOPER
Thank you.

Cooper walks slowly to the bathroom and closes the door.
CUT TO:


43. INT. COOPER'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Cooper looks at the sink, at his personal effects, he picks up the toothbrush, squeezes some toothpaste on it and lifts it to his mouth. He holds it in front of his mouth, looks into the mirror and smiles brightly. Looking into the mirror, staring back at him, is the face of Bob.
